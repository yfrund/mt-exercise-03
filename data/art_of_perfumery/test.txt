&quot; violet &quot; 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; tubereuse &quot; 1 &quot; Extract of vanilla , 1 / 4 &quot; &quot; Tolu , 1 / 4 &quot; Otto neroli , 10 drops . &quot;
almonds , 5 &quot; The <unk> cost of a perfume made in this manner would probably be too high to meet the demand of a retail druggist ; in such cases it may be diluted with rectified spirit to the extent &quot; to make it pay , &quot; and will yet be a nice perfume .
The formula generally given herein for odors is in <unk> that when bottled they will retail for at least <unk> the fluid ounce !
which is the average price put on the finest perfumery by the manufacturers of London and Paris .
<unk> perfume under this name is sold to a limited extent , but if it did not smell better than the plant _ Hovenia <unk> _ or _ H.
<unk> _ , a native of Japan , it would not sell at all .
The article in the market is made thus : -- Rectified spirit , 1 quart .
Rose-water , 1 / 2 pint .
Otto lemons , 1 / 2 oz .
Otto of rose , 1 drachm . &quot;
cloves , 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; neroli , 10 drops .
First dissolve the ottos in the spirit , then add the rose-water .
After filtration it is ready for sale .
When compounds of this kind do not become bright by passing through <unk> , the addition of a little carbonate of magnesia prior to filtering <unk> <unk> them .
The water in the above recipe is only added in order that the article produced may be retailed at a moderate price , and would , of course , be better without that &quot; universal friend . &quot;
<unk> &quot; <unk> above all , The jasmine <unk> wide her elegant <unk> . &quot;
This flower is one of the most prized by the perfumer .
Its odor is delicate and sweet , and so peculiar that it is without comparison , and as such cannot be imitated .
When the flowers of the _ <unk> odoratissimum _ are distilled , repeatedly using the water of distillation over fresh flowers , the essential oil of jasmine may be procured .
It is , however , exceedingly rare , on account of the enormous cost of production .
There was a fine sample of six ounces exhibited in the <unk> department of the Crystal Palace , the price of which was 9 _ l . _ the fluid ounce !
The plant is the <unk> of the <unk> , from which our name is derived .
In the perfumer &apos;s laboratory , the method of obtaining the odor is by absorption , or , as the French term it , _ enfleurage _ ; that is , by spreading a mixture of pure lard and suet on a glass <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> flowers all over it , leaving them to stand a day or so , and repeating the operation with fresh <unk> grease absorbs the odor .
Finally , the pomade is scraped off the glass or slate , melted at as low a temperature as possible , and strained .
Oils strongly impregnated with the fragrance are also prepared much in the same way .
<unk> of cotton wool , previously steeped in oil of ben ( obtained by pressure from the blanched nuts of the _ Moringa <unk> _ ) are covered with jasmine flowers , which is repeated several times ; finally , the cotton or linen cloths which some perfumers use , are squeezed under a press .
The jasmine oil thus produced is the _ Huile <unk> au jasmin _ of the French houses .
The &quot; extract of jasmine &quot; is prepared by pouring rectified spirit on the jasmine pomade or oil , and allowing them to remain together for a fortnight at a summer heat .
The best quality extract requires two pounds of pomatum to every quart of spirit .
The same can be done with the oil of jasmine .
If the pomade is used , it must be cut up fine previously to being put into the spirit ; if the oil is used , it must be shaken well together every two or more hours , otherwise , on account of its specific gravity , the oil separates , and but little surface is exposed to the spirit .
After the extract is strained off , the &quot; washed &quot; pomatum or oil is still useful , if remelted , in the composition of pomatum for the hair , and gives more satisfaction to a customer than any of the &quot; <unk> and <unk> , &quot; &amp; c . &amp; c . , made up and scented with essential oils ; the one smells of the flower , the other &quot; a <unk> . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Jasmine . &#93;
The extract of jasmine enters into the composition of a great many of the most approved handkerchief perfumes sold by the English and French perfumers .
Extract of jasmine is sold for the handkerchief often pure , but is one of those scents which , though very gratifying at first , becomes what people call &quot; sickly &quot; after exposure to the oxidizing influence of the air , but if <unk> mixed with other perfumes of an opposite character is sure to please the most <unk> customer .
<unk> scent of the jonquil is very beautiful ; for perfumery purposes it is however but little cultivated in comparison with jasmine and tubereuse .
It is prepared exactly as jasmine .
The Parisian perfumers sell a mixture which they call &quot; extract of jonquil . &quot;
The plant , however , only <unk> the part of a <unk> to the <unk> , giving it its name .
The so-called jonquil is made thus : -- Spirituous extract of jasmine pomade , 1 pint . &quot;
&quot; tubereuse &quot; 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; fleur d &apos;orange , 1 / 2 &quot; Extract of vanilla , 2 fluid ounces .
<unk> distillation from the berries of the _ Laurus <unk> _ , and from the leaves of the _ Laurus <unk> _ , an oil and perfumed water are procurable of a very beautiful and fragrant character .
<unk> , however , it is <unk> , as from the similarity of odor to the oil distilled from the bitter almond , it is rarely , if ever , used by the perfumer , the latter being more economical .
<unk> climate of England appears to be better adapted for the perfect development of this fine old favorite perfume than any other on the <unk> .
&quot; The ancients , &quot; says Burnett , &quot; employed the flowers and the leaves to <unk> their baths , and to give a sweet scent to water in which they washed ; hence the <unk> name of the plant , _ Lavandula _ . &quot;
Lavender is grown to an enormous extent at Mitcham , in Surrey , which is the <unk> of its production , in a commercial point of view .
Very large quantities are also grown in France , but the fine odor of the British produce <unk> in the market four times the price of that of <unk> growth .
Burnett says that the oil of _ Lavandula spica _ is more pleasant than that derived from the other species , but this statement must not <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the French spike lavender , as it is not worth a <unk> of that derived from the _ <unk> <unk> _ .
<unk> weight of good lavender flowers yield , by distillation , from 14 to 16 oz .
of essential oil .
All the inferior <unk> of oil of lavender are used for perfuming soaps and greases ; but the best , that obtained from the Mitcham lavender , is entirely used in the manufacture of what is called lavender water , but which , more properly , should be called essence or extract of lavender , to be in keeping with the nomenclature of other essences prepared with spirit .
The number of formulæ published for making a liquid perfume of lavender is almost <unk> , but the whole of them may be <unk> into essence of lavender , simple ; essence of lavender , compound ; and lavender water .
There are two methods of making essence of lavender : <unk> .
By distilling a mixture of essential oil of lavender and rectified spirit ; and the <unk> .
By merely mixing the oil and the spirit together .
The first process yields the finest quality : it is that which is adopted by the firm of <unk> and <unk> , <unk> reputation for this article is such that it gives a good character in foreign markets , especially India , to all products of lavender of English manufacture .
Lavender essence , that which is made by the still , is quite white , while that by mixture only always has a <unk> tint , which by age becomes <unk> and resinous .
<unk> &apos;S LAVENDER .
To produce a very fine distillate , <unk> Otto of English Lavender , 4 oz .
Rectified spirit ( 60 over proof ) , 5 pints .
Rose-water , 1 pint .
Mix and distil five pints for sale .
Such essence of lavender is expensive , but at 10 _ s . _ a pint of 14 oz !
there _ is _ a <unk> for profit .
It not being convenient to the general <unk> to sell distilled lavender essence , the following form , by mixture , will produce a <unk> article , and nearly as white as the above .
ESSENCE OF LAVENDER .
Otto of lavender , 3-1 / 2 oz .
Rectified spirit , 2 quarts .
The perfumer &apos;s retail price for such quality is 8 _ s . _ per pint of 14 oz .
Many perfumers and druggists in making lavender water or essence , use a small portion of bergamot , with an idea of <unk> its <unk> very erroneous opinion ; moreover , such lavender quickly <unk> .

COMMON LAVENDER <unk> form as the above , substituting French lavender for the British .
<unk> for Rondeletia , Lavender Bouquet , and other lavender compounds , will be given when we come to speak of compound perfumes , which will be reserved until we have finished explaining the method of making the simple essences .
<unk> fine perfume is abstracted from the _ Citrus <unk> _ , by expression , from the rind of the fruit .
The otto of lemons in the market is principally from <unk> , where there are hundreds of acres of &quot; lemon groves . &quot;
Otto of lemons , like all the ottos of the Citrus family , is rapidly prone to oxidation when in contact with air and exposure to light ; a high temperature is also detrimental , and as such is the case it should be preserved in a cool cellar .
Most of the samples from the <unk> shelves of the druggists &apos; shops , are as much like essence of turpentine , to the smell , as that of lemons ; rancid oil of lemons may , in a great measure , be purified by agitation with warm water and final <unk> .
When new and good , lemon otto may be freely used in combination with rosemary , cloves , and caraway , for perfuming powders for the <unk> .
From its rapid oxidation , it should not be used for perfuming grease , as it assists rather than otherwise all fats to turn rancid ; hence pomatums so perfumed will not keep well .
In the manufacture of other compound perfumes , it should be dissolved in spirit , in the proportion of six to eight ounces of oil to one gallon of spirit .
There is a large consumption of otto of lemons in the manufacture of Eau de Cologne ; that <unk> uses it is easily discovered by adding a few drops of Liq .
Ammoniæ <unk> .
to half an ounce of his Eau de Cologne , the smell of the lemon is thereby brought out in a remarkable manner .
Perhaps it is not out of place here to <unk> , that in attempts to discover the composition of certain perfumes , we are greatly assisted by the use of strong Liq .
Ammoniæ .
<unk> of the essential oils <unk> with the Ammonia , allow those which do not do so , if present in the compound , to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> to Pereira , the otto in the market under this name is derived from the _ Andropogon schoenanthus _ a species of grass which grows <unk> in India .
It is cultivated to a large extent in Ceylon and in the Moluccas <unk> for the otto , which from the plant is easily procured by distillation .
<unk> grass otto , or , as it is sometimes called , oil of verbena , on account of its similarity of odor to that favorite plant , is imported into this country in old English <unk> and <unk> bottles .
It is very powerful , well adapted for perfuming soaps and greases , but its principal consumption is in the manufacture of artificial essence of verbena .
From its comparatively low price , great strength , and fine perfume ( when diluted ) , the lemon grass otto may be much more used than at present , with considerable advantage to the retail <unk> .
<unk> fragrance of the flowers of this ornamental shrub is well known .
The essence of lilac is obtained either by the process of maceration , or enfleurage with grease , and afterwards treating the pomatum thus formed with rectified spirit , in the same manner as previously described for cassie ; the odor so much resembles tubereuse , as to be frequently used to adulterate the latter , the demand for tubereuse being at all times greater than the supply .
A beautiful IMITATION OF ESSENCE OF WHITE <unk> may be compounded thus : -- Spirituous extract from tubereuse pomade , 1 pint . &quot;
of orange-flower pomade , 1 / 4 &quot; Otto of almonds , 3 drops .
Extract of civet , 1 / 2 oz .
The civet is only used to give permanence to the perfume of the handkerchief .
<unk> manufacturing perfumer <unk> the advice of the <unk> writer , to &quot; consider the lilies of the field . &quot;
<unk> as they are in odor , they are not cultivated for their perfume .
If lilies are thrown into oil of sweet almonds , or ben oil , they impart to it their sweet smell ; but to obtain anything like fragrance , the infusion must be repeated a dozen times with the same oil , using fresh flowers for each infusion , after standing a day or so .
The oil being shaken with an equal quantity of spirit for a week , gives up its odor to the alcohol , and thus extract of lilies _ may _ be made .
But how it _ is _ made is thus : -- IMITATION &quot; <unk> OF THE <unk> . &quot;
Extract of tubereuse , 1 / 2 pint . &quot;
jasmine , 1 oz . &quot;
fleur d &apos;orange , 2 oz . &quot;
vanilla , 3 oz . &quot;
cassie , 1 / 4 pint . &quot;
rose , 1 / 4 &quot; Otto of almonds , 3 drops .
<unk> this mixture together for a month , and then bottle it for sale .
It is a perfume that is very much admired .
<unk> <unk> is used in the manufacture of some of those scented powders called <unk> .
A strong-smelling essential oil may be procured from it by distillation , but it is rarely used .
<unk> perfume of this flower is <unk> ; practically , however , it is of little use to the manufacturer , the large size of the blossoms and their comparative scarcity prevents their being used , but a very excellent imitation of its odor is made as under , and is that which is found in the perfumers &apos; shops of London and Paris .
IMITATION &quot; ESSENCE OF <unk> . &quot;
Spirituous extract of orange-flower pomatum , 1 pint . &quot;
&quot; rose pomatum , 2 pints . &quot;
&quot; tubereuse pomatum , 1 / 2 pint . &quot;

<unk> otto procured by distilling _ Origanum <unk> _ , commonly called oil of oringeat by the French , is exceedingly powerful , and in this respect resembles all the ottos from the different species of thyme , of which the marjoram is one .
One hundred weight of the dry herb yields about ten ounces of the otto .
<unk> oil is extensively used for perfuming soap , but more in France than in England .
It is the chief ingredient used by <unk> <unk> , of Paris , for scenting their &quot; <unk> <unk> Soap , &quot; so common in the London shops .
<unk> <unk> sweet-smelling otto can be produced by distilling the _ <unk> <unk> _ , but it is not used by perfumers .

See BALM .
<unk> for the exquisite odor of this little flower , it would scarcely be known otherwise than as a weed .
Sweet as it is in its natural state , and prolific in odor , we are not able to maintain its characteristic smell as an essence .
Like many others , during separation from the plant , the fragrance is more or less modified ; though not perfect , it still reminds the sense of the odor of the flowers .
To give it that sweetness which it appears to want , a certain quantity of violet is added to bring it up to the market odor .
As this plant is so very prolific in odor , we think something might be done with it in England , especially as it <unk> as well in this country as in France ; and we desire to see Flower <unk> and organized <unk> established in the British <unk> , for the extraction of essences and the manufacture of pomade and oils , of such flowers as are indigenous , or that <unk> in the open fields of our country .
Besides <unk> up a new field of enterprise and good <unk> for capital , it would give healthy employment to many women and <unk> .
<unk> air employment for the young is of no little consideration to maintain the stamina of the future <unk> ; for it cannot be <unk> that our <unk> <unk> and confined <unk> are <unk> to the physical condition of the human family .
To return from our <unk> .
The essence of <unk> , or , as it is more often sold under the name of Extrait de <unk> , is prepared by infusing the <unk> pomade in rectified spirit , in the proportion of one pound of pomade to one pint of spirit , allowing them to digest together for a fortnight , when the essence is filtered off the pomade .
One ounce of extrait d <unk> is added to every pint .
This is done to give permanence to the odor upon the handkerchief , and does not in any way alter its odor .
<unk> French name for artificial essence of almond ( see ALMOND ) .
<unk> the _ <unk> _ yield fragrant ottos by distillation .
The otto of the <unk> ( _ M.
<unk> _ ) is exceedingly powerful , and very valuable for perfuming soap , in conjunction with other perfumes .
Perfumers use the ottos of the mint in the manufacture of <unk> and dental liquids .
The leading ingredient in the celebrated &quot; eau Botot &quot; is oil of peppermint in alcohol .
A good imitation may be made thus : -- EAU DE BOTOT .
Tincture of cedar wood , 1 pint . &quot;
myrrh , 1 oz .
Oil of peppermint , 1 / 2 dr . &quot; <unk> mint , 1 / 4 dr . &quot; cloves , 10 drops . &quot;
roses , 10 &quot; <unk> of this formula can be readily suggested , but the main object is to retain the mint ottos , as they have more power than any other aromatic to overcome the smell of tobacco .
<unk> , it must be remembered , are as much used for <unk> the mouth after smoking as for a dentifrice .
<unk> very fragrant otto may be procured by distilling both flowers and leaves of the common myrtle ; one hundred-weight will yield about five ounces of the volatile oil .
The demand for essence of myrtle being very limited , the odor as found in the perfumers &apos; shops is very rarely a genuine article , but it is imitated thus : -- IMITATION ESSENCE OF <unk> .
Extract of vanilla , 1 / 2 pint . &quot;
roses 1 &quot; Extract of fleur d &apos;orange , 1 / 2 pint . &quot;
tubereuse , 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; jasmine , 2 oz .
Mix and allow to stand for a fortnight : it is then fit for bottling , and is a perfume that gives a great deal of satisfaction .
<unk> water is sold in France under the name of eau d <unk> , and may be prepared like rose , elder , or other flower waters .
NEROLI , OR <unk> distinct odors are procurable from the orange-blossom , varying according to the methods adopted for procuring them .
This difference of perfume from the same flower is a great advantage to the manufacturer .
This curious fact is worthy of inquiry by the chemical philosopher .
It is not peculiar to the orange-flower , but applies to many others , especially <unk> to all flowers .
When orange-flowers are treated by the maceration process , that is , by infusion in a fatty body , we procure orange-flower pomatum , its strength and quality being regulated by the number of <unk> of the flower made in the same grease .
By digesting this orange-flower pomatum in rectified spirits in the proportions of from six pounds to eight pounds of pomade to a gallon of spirit , for about a fortnight at a summer heat , we obtain the extrait de fleur d &apos;orange , or extract of orange-flowers , a handkerchief perfume <unk> by none .
In this state its odor resembles the original so much , that with closed eyes the best <unk> could not distinguish the scent of the extract from that of the flower .
The peculiar flowery odor of this extract renders it valuable to perfumers , not only to sell in a pure state , but slightly modified with other _ extraits _ passes for &quot; sweet pea , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &amp; c . , which it slightly resembles in fragrance .
&#91; Illustration : Orange . &#93;
Now , when orange-flowers are distilled with water , we procure the otto of the blossom , which is known commercially as oil of neroli .
The neroli procured from the flowers of the Citrus <unk> is considered to be the finest quality , and is called &quot; neroli petale . &quot;
The next quality , &quot; neroli bigarade , &quot; is derived from the blossoms of the _ Citrus <unk> _ , or <unk> orange .
Another quality , which is considered inferior to the preceding , is the neroli petit grain , obtained by distilling the leaves and the young unripe fruit of the different species of the <unk> .
The &quot; petale &quot; and &quot; bigarade &quot; neroli are used to an enormous extent in the manufacture of eau de Cologne and other handkerchief perfumes .
The petit grain is mainly consumed for scenting soap .
To form the esprit de neroli , dissolve 1-1 / 2 oz .
of neroli petale in one gallon of rectified spirits .
Although very agreeable , and extensively used in the manufacture of bouquets , it has no relation to the flowery odor of the extrait de fleur d &apos;orange , as derived from the same flowers by maceration ; in fact , it has as different an odor as though obtained from another plant , yet in theory both these _ extraits _ are but alcoholic solutions of the otto of the flower .
The water used for distillation in procuring the neroli , when well freed from the oil , is imported into this country under the name of eau de fleur d &apos;orange , and may be used , like elder-flower and rose-water , for the skin , and as an eye <unk> .
It is remarkable for its fine fragrance , and it is <unk> that it is not more used , being moderate in price .
( See _ Syringa _ . )
<unk> beautiful odor of the nutmeg is familiar to all .
Though an otto can be drawn from them of a very fragrant character , it is rarely used in perfumery .
The ground nuts are , however , used advantageously in the combinations of scented powders used for scent <unk> &quot; <unk> &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
<unk> is a gum resin , used to a limited extent in this country , in the manufacture of incense and pastilles .
It is chiefly interesting as being one of those odoriferous bodies of which frequent mention is made in the Holy volume .
&#91; C &#93; &quot; It is believed , &quot; says Burnett , &quot; to have been one of the ingredients in the sweet incense of the Jews ; and it is still burnt as incense in the Greek and Romish churches , where the diffusion of such odors round the altar forms a part of the <unk> religious service . &quot;
Olibanum is partially soluble in alcohol , and , like most of the balsams , probably owes its perfume to a peculiar odoriferous body , associated with the benzoic acid it contains .
For making the tincture or extract of olibanum , take 1 pound of the gum to 1 gallon of the spirit .
<unk> the title &quot; Neroli &quot; we have already spoken of the odoriferous principle of the orange-blossom .
We have now to speak of what is known in the market as Essence of Orange , or , as it is more frequently termed , Essence of Portugal , <unk> name , however , which we cannot admit in a <unk> <unk> of the &quot; odors of plants . &quot;
The otto of orange-peel , or odoriferous principle of the orange fruit , is procured by expression and by distillation .
The peel is <unk> in order to crush the little vessels or sacs that <unk> the otto .
Its abundance in the peel is shown by <unk> a piece near the flame of a candle ; the otto that <unk> out <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
It has many uses in perfumery , and from its refreshing fragrance finds many admirers .
It is the leading ingredient in what is sold as &quot; <unk> Water &quot; and &quot; Eau de Portugal . &quot;
The following is a very useful form for preparing <unk> WATER .
Rectified spirit ( not less than 60 over proof ) , 1 gallon .
Otto of orange peel , 3 oz . &quot;
lemon peel , 3 oz . &quot;
rose 1 / 4 oz .
This is a form for EAU DE PORTUGAL .
Rectified spirit ( 60 over proof ) , 1 gallon .
Essential oil of orange peel , 6 oz . &quot;
lemon peel , 1 oz . &quot;
lemon grass , 1 / 4 oz . &quot;
bergamot , 1 oz . &quot;
otto of rose , 1 / 4 oz .
It should be noted that these perfumes are never to be filled into wet bottles , for if in any way damp from water , a minute portion of the ottos are separated , which gives an opalescent appearance to the mixture .
<unk> , all bottles should be _ spirit <unk> _ prior to being filled with any perfume , but especially with those containing essences of orange or lemon peel .
ORRIS , properly <unk> dried rhizome of _ Iris <unk> _ has a very pleasant odor , which , for the want of a better comparison , is said to resemble the smell of violets ; it is , however , exceedingly <unk> to the <unk> aroma of that modest flower when such <unk> <unk> are made .
Nevertheless the perfume of iris root is good , and well worthy of the place it has obtained as a perfuming substance .
The powder of orris root is very extensively used in the manufacture of sachet powders , <unk> , &amp; c . It <unk> that celebrated &quot; <unk> herb &quot; known as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
For tincture of orris , or , as the perfumers call it , EXTRACT OF ORRIS , Take orris root , crushed , 7 lbs .
Rectified spirits , 1 gallon .
After standing together for about a fortnight , the extract is fit to take off .
It requires considerable time to drain away , and , to prevent loss , the remainder of the orris should be placed in the tincture press .
This extract enters into the composition of many of the most celebrated bouquets , such as &quot; Jockey Club , &quot; and others , but is never sold alone , because its odor , although <unk> , is not sufficiently good to stand public opinion upon its own <unk> ; but in combination its value is very great ; possessing little aroma itself , yet it has the power of <unk> the odor of other fragrant bodies ; like the <unk> and <unk> , which though comparatively <unk> , readily fire <unk> bodies .
<unk> odor of palm <unk> fat oil of <unk> due to a fragrant principle which it contains .
By infusion in alcohol , the odoriferous body is dissolved , and resembles , to a certain extent , the tincture of orris , or of extract of violet , but is very indifferent , and is not likely to be brought into use , though several attempts have been made to render it of service when the cultivation of the violets have <unk> from bad seasons .
<unk> _ <unk> patchouly _ ( LINDLEY ) , _ <unk> <unk> _ ( <unk> ) , is an herb that grows extensively in India and China .
It somewhat resembles our garden sage in its growth and form , but the leaves are not so fleshy .
&#91; Illustration : Patchouly . &#93;
The odor of patchouly is due to an otto contained in the leaves and stems , and is readily procured by distillation .
1 cwt .
of good herb will yield about 28 oz .
of the essential oil , which is of a dark brown color , and of a density about the same as that of oil of sandal wood , which it resembles in its physical character .
Its odor is the most powerful of any derived from the botanic kingdom ; hence , if mixed in the proportion of measure for measure , it completely covers the smell of all other bodies .
EXTRACT OF PATCHOULY .
Rectified spirit , 1 gallon .
Otto of patchouly , 1-1 / 4 oz . &quot;
rose , 1 / 4 oz .
The essence of patchouly thus made is that which is found in the perfumers &apos; shops of Paris and London .
Although few perfumes have had such a fashionable run , yet when smelled at in its pure state , it is far from agreeable , having a kind of <unk> or <unk> odor , analogous to <unk> , or , as some say , it smells of &quot; old <unk> . &quot;
The characteristic smell of Chinese or Indian ink is due to some admixture of this herb .
The origin of the use of patchouly as a perfume in Europe is curious .
A few years ago real Indian shawls <unk> an extravagant price , and <unk> could always distinguish them by their odor ; in fact , they were perfumed with patchouly .
The French manufacturers had for some time successfully imitated the Indian fabric , but could not impart the odor .
At length they discovered the secret , and began to import the plant to perfume articles of their make , and thus palm off <unk> shawls as real Indian !
From this origin the perfumers have brought it into use .
Patchouly herb is extensively used for scenting drawers in which linen is kept ; for this purpose it is best to powder the leaves and put them into muslin sacks , covered with silk , after the manner of the old-fashioned <unk> .
In this state it is very <unk> in preventing the clothes from being attacked by <unk> .
Several combinations of patchouly will be given in the recipes for &quot; bouquets and nosegays . &quot;
PEA ( SWEET ) .--A very fine odor may be abstracted from the flowers of the <unk> by maceration in any fatty body , and then digesting the pomade produced in spirit .
It is , however , rarely manufactured , because a very close IMITATION OF THE ESSENCE OF SWEET PEA .
can be prepared thus : -- Extract of tuberose , 1 / 2 pint . &quot;
fleur d &apos;orange , 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; rose from pomatum , 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; vanilla , 1 oz .
<unk> , like sounds , appear to influence the olfactory nerve in certain definite degrees .
There is , as it were , an octave of odors like an octave in music ; certain odors <unk> , like the <unk> of an instrument .
Such as almond , heliotrope , vanilla , and <unk> blend together , each producing different degrees of a nearly similar impression .
Again , we have citron , lemon , orange-peel , and verbena , forming a higher octave of smells , which blend in a similar manner .
The metaphor is completed by what we are <unk> to call <unk> , such as rose and rose geranium for the half note ; <unk> grain , neroli , a black key , followed by fleur d &apos;orange .
<unk> we have <unk> , sandal-wood , and vitivert , and many others running into each other .
From the odors already known we may produce , by uniting them in proper proportion , the smell of almost any flower , except jasmine .
The odor of some flowers resembles others so nearly that we are almost <unk> to believe them to be the same thing , or , at least , if not evolved from the plant as such , to become so by the action of the <unk> .
It is known that some actually are identical in composition , although produced from totally different plants , such as camphor , turpentine , rosemary .
Hence we may presume that chemistry will sooner or later produce one from the other , for with many it is merely an atom of water or an atom of oxygen that causes the difference .
It would be a <unk> thing to produce otto of roses from oil of rosemary , or from the rose geranium oil , and theory indicates its possibility .
The essential oil of almonds in a bottle that contains a good deal of <unk> , and but a very little of the oil , spontaneously passes into another odoriferous body , benzoic acid ; which is seen in crystals to form over the dry parts of the <unk> .
This is a natural <unk> of this idea .
In giving the recipe for &quot; sweet pea &quot; as above , we form it with the impression that its odor resembles the orange-blossom , which similarity is <unk> nearer by the addition of the rose and tuberose .
The vanilla is used merely to give permanence to the scent on the handkerchief , and this latter body is <unk> in preference to extract of musk or ambergris , which would answer the same purpose of giving permanence to the more volatile ingredients ; because the vanilla <unk> the same key of the olfactory nerve as the orange-blossom , and thus no new idea of a different scent is brought about as the perfume dies off from the handkerchief .
When perfumes are not mixed upon this principle , then we hear that such and such a perfume becomes &quot; sickly &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; after they have been on the handkerchief a short time .
<unk> Dr. Hoffman and Dr. Lyon Playfair have fallen into some error in their <unk> with regard to the application of this odor in perfumery .
After various practical experiments conducted in a large perfumatory , we have come to the conclusion that it cannot be so applied , simply because when the essence of pine-apple is smelled at , the vapor produces an <unk> action of the <unk> , producing cough , when exceedingly dilute .
Even in the infinitesimal portions it still produces disagreeable <unk> of the <unk> , which , if prolonged , such as is expected if used upon a handkerchief , is followed by intense <unk> .
It is obvious , therefore , that the <unk> use of the essence of pine-apple ( butyric ether ) cannot be adapted with benefit to the manufacturing perfumer , although <unk> to the <unk> as a flavoring material .
What we have here said refers to the artificial essence of pine-apple , or butyrate of ethyloxide , which , if very much diluted with alcohol , resembles the smell of pine-apple , and hence its name ; but how far the same observations are applicable to the true essential oil from the fruit or <unk> of the pine-apple , remains to be seen _ when _ we procure it .
As the West Indian <unk> are now <unk> freely into the market , the day is probably not distant when <unk> experiments can be tried ; but hitherto it must be remembered our experiments have only been performed with a body _ resembling in smell _ the true essential oil of the fruit .
The physical action of all ethers upon the human body is quite sufficient to prevent their application in perfumery , however useful in <unk> , which it is understood has to deal with another of the senses , <unk> of smell , but of taste .
The commercial &quot; essence of pine-apple , &quot; or &quot; pine-apple oil , &quot; and &quot; jargonelle pear-oil , &quot; are admitted only to be _ labelled _ such , but really are certain organic acid ethers .
For the present , then , perfumers must only look on these bodies as so many <unk> in the &quot; <unk> of Science , &quot; which , for the present , are without practical application in his art .

It is remarkable how very much this mixture resembles the odor of the flower , and the public never doubt its being the &quot; real thing . &quot;
<unk> rose-wood , the lignum of the _ <unk> <unk> _ , is distilled , a sweet-smelling oil is procured , resembling in some slight degree the fragrance of the rose , and hence its name .
At one time , that is , prior to the cultivation of the rose-leaf geranium , the <unk> from rose-wood and from the root of the _ <unk> <unk> _ ( <unk> ) , were principally drawn for the adulteration of real otto of roses , but as the geranium oil answers so much better , the oil of rhodium has fallen into <unk> , hence its comparative scarcity in the market at the present day , though our <unk> <unk> it well .
One cwt .
of wood yields about three ounces of oil .
Ground rose-wood is valuable as a basis in the manufacture of sachet powders for perfuming the <unk> .
The French have given the name jacaranda to rose-wood , under the idea that the plant called jacaranda by the <unk> yields it , which is not the case ; &quot; the same word has perhaps been the origin of <unk> , badly written . &quot; -- _ Burnett _ .

This <unk> of the garden loses not its <unk> in the perfuming world .
The oil of roses , or , as it is commonly called , the otto , or attar , of roses , is procured ( contrary to so many opposite statements ) simply by distilling the roses with water .
The otto , or attar , of rose of commerce is derived from the _ <unk> <unk> <unk> _ .
Very extensive rose farms exist at Adrianople ( Turkey in Europe ) ; at Broussa , now famous as the residence of <unk> ; and at Uslak ( Turkey in Asia ) ; also at Ghazepore , in India .
The <unk> in Turkey are principally the <unk> <unk> of the low countries of the Balkan , between <unk> , and <unk> , as far as <unk> , in <unk> , about 200 <unk> from Constantinople .
In good seasons , this <unk> yields <unk> ounces ; but in bad seasons only 20,000 to <unk> ounces of attar are obtained .
It is estimated that it requires at least 2000 rose blooms to yield one drachm of otto .
The otto slightly varies in odor from different <unk> ; many places <unk> an otto which <unk> more readily than others , and , therefore , this is not a sure <unk> of purity , though many consider it such .
That which was exhibited in the Crystal Palace of 1851 , as &quot; from Ghazepore , &quot; in India , obtained the <unk> .
&quot; <unk> of roses , made in <unk> , is considered superior to any other ; a <unk> not <unk> , as , according to <unk> , the flower is here produced of <unk> fragrance as well as beauty .
A large quantity of rose-water twice distilled is allowed to run off into an open vessel , placed over night in a cool running stream , and in the morning the oil is found floating on the surface in minute specks , which are taken off very carefully by means of a blade of <unk> .
When cool it is of a dark green color , and as hard as resin , not becoming liquid at a temperature about that of boiling water .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> pounds &apos; weight of leaves is required to produce one ounce of the attar . &quot;
-- _ Indian <unk> . _ Pure otto of roses , from its <unk> sweetness , has not many admirers ; when diluted , however , there is nothing to equal it in odor , especially if mixed in soap , to form rose soap , or in pure spirit , to form the esprit de rose .
The soap not allowing the perfume to evaporate very fast , we cannot be <unk> with the smell of the otto .
The finest preparation of rose as an odor is made at Grasse , in France .
Here the flowers are not treated for the otto , but are subjected to the process of maceration in fat , or in oil , as described under jasmine , heliotrope , &amp; c . The rose pomade thus made , if digested in alcohol , say 8 lbs .
of No .
24 Pomade to one gallon of spirit , yields an esprit de rose of the first order , very superior to that which is made by the addition of otto to spirit .
It is difficult to account for this difference , but it is sufficiently characteristic to form a distinct odor .
See the article on fleur d &apos;orange and neroli ( pp .
<unk> , <unk> ) , which have similar qualities , previously described .
The esprit de rose made from the French rose pomade is never sold retail by the perfumer ; he <unk> this to form part of his _ <unk> _ bouquets .
Some wholesale druggists have , however , been <unk> it now for some time to country <unk> , for them to form <unk> rose-water , which it does to great perfection .
Roses are cultivated to a large extent in England , near Mitcham , in Surrey , for perfumers &apos; use , to make rose-water .
In the season when <unk> crops can be got , which is about the end of <unk> , or the early part of July , they are gathered as soon as the <unk> is off , and sent to <unk> in sacks .
When they arrive , they are immediately spread out upon a cool <unk> : otherwise , if left in a <unk> , they heat to such an extent , in two or three hours , as to be quite spoiled .
There is no organic matter which so rapidly absorbs oxygen , and becomes heated spontaneously , as a mass of freshly gathered roses .
To preserve these roses , the London perfumers immediately <unk> them ; for this purpose , the leaves are separated from the <unk> , and to every <unk> of flowers , equal to about six pounds &apos; weight , one pound of common salt is thoroughly rubbed in .
The salt absorbs the water existing in the petals , and rapidly becomes <unk> , reducing the whole to a pasty mass , which is finally <unk> away in <unk> .
In this way they will keep almost any length of time , without the fragrance being seriously <unk> .
A good rose-water can be prepared by distilling 12 lbs .
of <unk> roses , and 2-1 / 2 gallons of water .
&quot; Draw &quot; off two gallons ; the product will be the <unk> rose-water of the shops .
The rose-water that is imported from the South of France is , however , very superior in odor to any that can be produced here .
As it is a <unk> product of the distillation of roses for procuring the attar , it has a richness of aroma which appears to be <unk> with <unk> roses .
There are four modifications of essence of rose for the handkerchief , which are the _ <unk> plus <unk> _ of the perfumer &apos;s art .
They are , <unk> de rose triple , essence of white of roses , essence of <unk> rose , and essence of moss rose .
The following are the recipes for their formation : -- <unk> DE ROSE <unk> .

SHAKSPEARE .
By distilling the _ <unk> officinalis _ a thin <unk> otto is procured , having the characteristic odor of the plant , which is more aromatic than sweet .
One cwt .
of the fresh herb yields about twenty-four ounces of oil .
Otto of rosemary is very extensively used in perfumery , especially in combination with other ottos for scenting soap .
Eau de Cologne cannot be made without it , and in the once famous &quot; Hungary water &quot; it is the leading ingredient .
The following is the composition of <unk> WATER .
Rectified alcohol , 1 gallon .
Otto of English rosemary , 2 oz . &quot;
lemon-peel , 1 oz . &quot;
balm ( _ Melissa _ ) , 1 oz . &quot;
mint , 1 / 2 drachm .
Esprit de rose , 1 pint .
Extract of fleur d &apos;orange , 1 &quot; It is put up for sale in a similar way to eau de Cologne , and is said to take its name from one of the <unk> of Hungary , who is reported to have derived great benefit from a bath containing it , at the age of <unk> years .
There is no doubt that <unk> and <unk> , while speaking for any time , would derive great benefit from perfuming their handkerchief with Hungary water or eau de Cologne , as the rosemary they contain <unk> the mind to <unk> action , sufficient of the <unk> being <unk> by occasionally <unk> the face with the handkerchief <unk> with these &quot; waters . &quot;
Shakspeare giving us the key , we can understand how it is that such perfumes containing rosemary are universally said to be &quot; so refreshing ! &quot;
<unk> <unk> otto can be procured by distillation from any of the _ <unk> _ .
It is rarely used , but is nevertheless very valuable in combination for scenting soap .

This is an old favorite with the lovers of scent ; it is the wood that possesses the odor .
The finest santal-wood grows in the <unk> of <unk> , and the Santal-wood <unk> , where it is extensively cultivated for the Chinese market .
In the religious ceremonies of the <unk> , <unk> , and Chinese , santal-wood is burned , by way of incense , to an extent almost beyond <unk> .
The _ <unk> _ <unk> plentifully in China , but the continued <unk> to the Buddahs have almost <unk> the plant from the Celestial Empire ; and such is the demand , that it is about to be cultivated in Western Australia , in the <unk> of a profitable return , which we doubt not will be realized ; England alone would consume <unk> the quantity it does were its price within the range of other perfuming substances .
The otto which exists in the santal-wood is readily procured by distillation ; 1 cwt .
of good wood will yield about 30 ounces of otto .
&#91; Illustration : Santal-wood . &#93;
The white <unk> , which is so common in India and China , <unk> into every organic matter that it comes across , appears to have no <unk> for santal-wood ; hence it is frequently made into <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &amp; c . This quality , together with its fragrance , renders it a valuable article to the <unk> of the East .
The otto of santal is <unk> dense , and is above all others <unk> in its appearance , and , when good , is of a dark <unk> color .
When dissolved in spirit , it enters into the composition of a great many of the old-fashioned bouquets , such as &quot; <unk> , &quot; and others , the formulæ of which will be given hereafter .
Perfumers thus make what is called EXTRAIT DE BOIS DE <unk> .
Rectified spirits , 7 pints .
Esprit de rose , 1 pint .
Essential oil , _ i.e. _ otto , of santal , 3 oz .
All those EXTRACTS , made by dissolving the otto in alcohol , are nearly white , or at least only slightly tinted by the color of the oil used .
When a perfumer has to impart a delicate _ odeur _ to a lady &apos;s _ <unk> _ , which in some instances costs &quot; no end of money , &quot; and is an object , at any cost , to retain <unk> , it behooves his reputation to sell an article that will not stain a delicate white fabric .
Now , when a perfume is made in a direct manner from any wood or herb , as tinctures are made , that is , by infusion in alcohol , there is obtained , besides the odoriferous substance , a solution of coloring and <unk> matter , which is exceedingly detrimental to its fragrance , besides seriously <unk> any <unk> handkerchief that it may be used upon ; and for this reason this latter method should never be adopted , except for use upon silk <unk> .
The odor of santal <unk> well with rose ; and hence , prior to the cultivation of rose-leaf geranium , it was used to adulterate otto of roses ; but is now but seldom used for that purpose .
By a &quot; <unk> &quot; error , santal is often printed &quot; sandal , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
<unk> of the perfumers of Germany use a tincture of the wood of the _ Laurus sassafras _ in the manufacture of hair-washes and other nostrums ; but as , in our opinion , it has rather a &quot; <unk> &quot; smell than flowery , we cannot recommend the German recipes .
The _ Eau <unk> _ , notwithstanding , has some reputation as a <unk> , but is little else than a weak tincture of sassafras .
<unk> oil of lavender , which is procured from the _ Lavandula spica _ , is generally called oil of spike .
( See Lavender . )
<unk> and <unk> are used in perfumery in the same way as benzoin , namely , by solution in spirit as a tincture .
An ounce of tincture of storax , tolu , or benzoin , being added to a pound of any very volatile perfume , gives a degree of permanence to it , and makes it last longer on the handkerchief than it otherwise would : thus , when any perfume is made by the solution of an otto in spirit , it is usual to add to it a small portion of a substance which is less volatile , such as extract of musk , extract of vanilla , ambergris , storax , tolu , orris , vitivert , or benzoin ; the manufacturer using his judgment and <unk> as to which of these materials are to be employed , <unk> , of course , those which are most compatible with the odor he is making .
The power which these bodies have of &quot; fixing &quot; a volatile substance , renders them valuable to the perfumer , independent of their aroma , which is due in many cases to benzoic acid , slightly modified by an <unk> oil peculiar to each substance , and which is taken up by the alcohol , together with a portion of resin .
When the perfume is put upon a handkerchief , the most volatile bodies disappear first : thus , after the alcohol has evaporated , the odor of the ottos appear stronger ; if it contains any resinous body , the ottos are held in solution , as it were , by the resin , and thus retained on the fabric .
<unk> a perfume to be made of otto only , without any &quot; fixing &quot; substance , then , as the perfume &quot; dies away , &quot; the olfactory nerve , if tutored , will detect its composition , for it spontaneously <unk> itself , no two ottos having the same volatility : thus , make a mixture of rose , jasmine , and patchouly ; the jasmine predominates first , then the rose , and , lastly , the patchouly , which will be found hours after the others have <unk> .
<unk> flowers of the _ <unk> <unk> _ , or common garden syringa , have an intense odor resembling the orange-blossom ; so much so , that in America the plant is often termed &quot; <unk> orange . &quot;
A great deal of the pomatum sold as <unk> <unk> , à la fleur d &apos;orange , by the manufacturers of Cannes , is nothing more than fine suet perfumed with syringa blossoms by the maceration process .
Fine syringa pomade could be made in England at a quarter the cost of what is paid for the so-called orange pomatum .
<unk> the different species of thyme , but more particularly the lemon thyme , the _ <unk> <unk> _ , as well as the <unk> , origanum , &amp; c . , yield by distillation fragrant ottos , that are extensively used by manufacturing perfumers for scenting soaps ; though well adapted for this purpose , they do not answer at all in any other combinations .
Both in grease and in spirit all these ottos impart an <unk> smell ( very naturally ) rather than a flowery one , and , as a consequence , they are not considered _ recherché _ .
When any of these herbs are dried and ground , they <unk> enter into the composition of sachet powders .
TONQUIN , or <unk> seeds of the _ <unk> odorata _ are the tonquin or _ <unk> _ beans of commerce .
When fresh they are exceedingly fragrant , having an intense odor of newly made hay .
The _ Anthoxanthum <unk> _ , or sweet-smelling vernal grass , to which new hay owes its odor , probably yields <unk> the same fragrant principle , and it is remarkable that both tonquin beans and vernal grass , while actually growing , are nearly scentless , but become rapidly aromatic when <unk> from the <unk> stock .
Chemically considered , tonquin beans are very interesting , containing , when fresh , a fragrant volatile otto ( to which their odor is principally due ) , benzoic acid , a fat oil and a neutral <unk> _ <unk> _ .
