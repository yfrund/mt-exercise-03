The Oil of Behn , being a perfectly inodorous fat oil , is a valuable agent for extracting the odors of flowers by the maceration process .
At no distant period I hope to see , either at the Crystal Palace , Sydenham , at the Royal Botanical Gardens , Kew , or elsewhere , a place to illustrate the commercial use of flowers--eye-lectures on the methods of obtaining the odors of plants and their various uses .
The horticulturists of England , being generally unacquainted with the methods of economizing the scents from the flowers they cultivate , entirely lose what would be a very profitable source of income .
For many ages copper ore was thrown over the cliffs into the sea by the Cornish miners working the tin streams ; how much wealth was thus cast away by ignorance we know not , but there is a perfect parallel between the old miners and the modern gardeners .
Many readers of the &quot; Gardeners &apos; Chronicle &quot; and of the &quot; Annals of Pharmacy and Chemistry &quot; will recognize in the following pages much matter that has already passed under their eyes .
To be of the service intended , such matter must however have a book form ; I have therefore collected from the above-mentioned periodicals all that I considered might be useful to the reader .
To Sir Wm .
Hooker , Dr. Lindley , Mr. W. Dickinson , and Mr. W. Bastick , I respectfully tender my thanks for the assistance they have so freely given whenever I have had occasion to seek their advice .

INTRODUCTION AND HISTORY .
SECTION I.
&quot; By Nature &apos;s swift and secret working hand The garden glows , and fills the liberal air With lavish odors .
There let me draw Ethereal soul , there drink reviving gales , Profusely breathing from the spicy groves And vales of fragrance . &quot; --THOMSON .
Among the numerous gratifications derived from the cultivation of flowers , that of rearing them for the sake of their perfumes stands pre-eminent .
It is proved from the oldest records , that perfumes have been in use from the earliest periods .
The origin of this , like that of many other arts , is lost in the depth of its antiquity ; though it had its rise , no doubt , in religious observances .
Among the nations of antiquity , an offering of perfumes was regarded as a token of the most profound respect and homage .
Incense , or Frankincense , which exudes by incision and dries as a gum , from _ Arbor-thurifera _ , was formerly burnt in the temples of all religions , in honor of the divinities that were there adored .
Many of the primitive Christians were put to death because they would not offer incense to idols .
&quot; Of the use of these luxuries by the Greeks , and afterwards by the Romans , Pliny and Seneca gives much information respecting perfume drugs , the method of collecting them , and the prices at which they sold .
Oils and powder perfumery were most lavishly used , for even three times a day did some of the luxurious people anoint and scent themselves , carrying their precious perfumes with them to the baths in costly and elegant boxes called NARTHECIA . &quot;
In the Romish Church incense is used in many ceremonies , and particularly at the solemn funerals of the hierarchy , and other personages of exalted rank .
Pliny makes a note of the tree from which frankincense is procured , and certain passages in his works indicate that dried flowers were used in his time by way of perfume , and that they were , as now , mixed with spices , a compound which the modern perfumer calls _ pot-pourri _ , used for scenting apartments , and generally placed in some ornamental Vase .
It was not uncommon among the Egyptian ladies to carry about the person a little pouch of odoriferous gums , as is the case to the present day among the Chinese , and to wear beads made of scented wood .
The &quot; bdellium &quot; mentioned by Moses in Genesis is a perfuming gum , resembling frankincense , if not identical with it .
Several passages in Exodus prove the use of perfumes at a very early period among the Hebrews .
In the thirtieth chapter of Exodus the Lord said unto Moses : &quot; 1 .
And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon ; of Shittim wood shalt thou make it . &quot;
&quot; 7 .
And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning ; when he dresseth the lamps he shall burn incense upon it . &quot;
&quot; 34 .
Take unto thee sweet spices , stacte , and onycha , and galbanum ; these sweet spices with pure frankincense : of each shall there be a like weight . &quot;
&quot; 35 .
And thou shalt make it a perfume , a confection after the art of the apothecary , tempered together pure and holy . &quot;
&quot; 36 .
And thou shalt beat some of it very small , and put of it before the testimony in the tabernacle of the congregation , where I will meet with thee ; it shall be unto you most holy . &quot;
&quot; 37 .
And as for the perfume which thou shalt make , ye shall not make to yourselves according to the composition thereof ; it shall be unto thee holy for the Lord . &quot;
&quot; 38 .
Whosoever shall make like unto that to smell thereto , shall even be cut off from his people . &quot;
&quot; It was from this religious custom , of employing incense in the ancient temples , that the royal prophet drew that beautiful simile of his , when he petitioned that his prayers might ascend before the Lord like incense , Luke 1 : 10 .
It was while all the multitude was praying without , at the hour of incense , that there appeared to Zachary an angel of the Lord , standing on the right side of the altar of incense .
That the nations attached a meaning not only of personal reverence , but also of religious homage , to an offering of incense , is demonstrable from the instance of the Magi , who , having fallen down to adore the new-born Jesus , and recognized his Divinity , presented Him with gold , myrrh and frankincense .
The primitive Christians imitated the example of the Jews , and adopted the use of incense at the celebration of the Liturgy .
St. Ephræm , a father of the Syriac Church , directed in his will that no aromatic perfumes should be bestowed upon him at his funeral , but that the spices should rather be given to the sanctuary .
The use of incense in all the Oriental churches is perpetual , and almost daily ; nor do any of them ever celebrate their Liturgy without it , unless compelled by necessity .
The Coptic , as well as other Eastern Christians , observe the same ceremonial as the Latin Church in incensing their altar , the sacred vessels , and ecclesiastical personages . &quot; --DR .
ROCK &apos;S _ Hierurgia _ .
Perfumes were used in the Church service , not only under the form of incense , but also mixed in the oil and wax for the lamps and lights commanded to be burned in the house of the Lord .
The brilliancy and fragrance which were often shed around a martyr &apos;s sepulchre , at the celebration of his festival , by multitudes of lamps and tapers , fed with aromatics , have been noticed by St. Paulinus : -- &quot; With crowded lamps are these bright altars crowned , And waxen tapers , shedding perfume round From fragrant wicks , beam calm a scented ray , To gladden night , and joy e &apos;en radiant day . &quot;
DR. ROCK &apos;S _ Hierurgia _ .
Constantine the Great provided fragrant oils , to be burned at the altars of the greater churches in Rome ; and St. Paulinus , of Nola , a writer of the end of the fourth and beginning of the fifth century , tells us how , in his times , wax tapers were made for church use , so as to shed fragrance as they burned : -- &quot; Lumina cerates adolentur odora papyris . &quot;
A perfume in common use , even to this day , was the invention of one of the earliest of the Roman nobles , named Frangipani , and still bears his name ; it is a powder , or sachet , composed of every known spice , in equal proportions , to which is added ground iris or orris root , in weight equal to the whole , with one per cent .
of musk or civet .
A liquid of the same name , invented by his grandson Mercutio Frangipani , is also in common use , prepared by digesting the Frangipane powder in rectified spirits , which dissolves out the fragrant principles .
This has the merit of being the most lasting perfume made .
&quot; The trade for the East in perfume-drugs caused many a vessel to spread its sails to the Red Sea , and many a camel to plod over that tract which gave to Greece and Syria their importance as markets , and vitality to the rocky city of Petra .
Southern Italy was not long ere it occupied itself in ministering to the luxury of the wealthy , by manufacturing scented unguents and perfumes .
So numerous were the UNGUENTARII , or perfumers , that they are said to have filled the great street of ancient Capua . &quot; --HOFMANN .
As an art , in England , perfumery has attained little or no distinction .
This has arisen from those who follow it as a trade , maintaining a mysterious secrecy about their processes .
No manufacture can ever become great or important to the community that is carried on under a veil of mystery .
&quot; On the subject of trade mystery I will only observe , that I am convinced that it would be far more to the interest of manufacturers if they were more willing to profit by the experience of others , and less fearful and jealous of the supposed secrets of their craft .
It is a great mistake to think that a successful manufacturer is one who has carefully preserved the secrets of his trade , or that peculiar modes of effecting simple things , processes unknown in other factories , and mysteries beyond the comprehension of the vulgar , are in any way essential to skill as a manufacturer , or to success as a trader . &quot;
--PROFESSOR SOLLY .
If the horticulturists of England were instructed how to collect the odors of flowers , a new branch of manufacture would spring up to vie with our neighbors &apos; skill in it across the Channel .
Of our five senses , that of SMELLING has been treated with comparative indifference .
However , as knowledge progresses , the various faculties with which the Creator has thought proper in his wisdom to endow man will become developed , and the faculty of Smelling will meet with its share of tuition as well as Sight , Hearing , Touch , and Taste .
Flowers yield perfumes in all climates , but those growing in the warmer latitudes are most prolific in their odor , while those from the colder are the sweetest .
Hooker , in his travels in Iceland , speaks of the delightful fragrance of the flowers in the valley of Skardsheidi ; we know that winter-green , violets , and primroses are found here , and the wild thyme , in great abundance .
Mr. Louis Piesse , in company with Captain Sturt , exploring the wild regions of South Australia , writes : &quot; The rains have clothed the earth with a green as beautiful as a Shropshire meadow in May , and with flowers , too , as sweet as an English violet ; the pure white anemone resembles it in scent .
The Yellow Wattle , when in flower , is splendid , and emits a most fragrant odor . &quot;
Though many of the finest perfumes come from the East Indies , Ceylon , Mexico , and Peru , the South of Europe is the only real garden of utility to the perfumer .
Grasse and Nice are the principal seats of the art ; from their geographical position , the grower , within comparatively short distances , has at command that change of climate best fitted to bring to perfection the plants required for his trade .
On the seacoast his Cassiæ grows without fear of frost , one night of which would destroy all the plants for a season ; while , nearer the Alps , his violets are found sweeter than if grown in the warmer situations , where the orange tree and mignionette bloom to perfection .
England can claim the superiority in the growth of lavender and peppermint ; the essential oils extracted from these plants grown at Mitcham , in Surrey , realize eight times the price in the market of those produced in France or elsewhere , and are fully worth the difference for delicacy of odor .
The odors of plants reside in different parts of them , sometimes in the roots , as in the iris and vitivert ; the stem or wood , in cedar and sandal ; the leaves , in mint , patchouly , and thyme ; the flower , in the roses and violets ; the seeds in the Tonquin bean and caraway ; the bark , in cinnamon , &amp; c . Some plants yield more than one odor , which are quite distinct and characteristic .
The orange tree , for instance , gives three--from the leaves one called _ petit grain _ ; from the flowers we procure _ neroli _ ; and from the rind of the fruit , essential oil of orange , _ essence of Portugal _ .
On this account , perhaps , this tree is the most valuable of all to the operative perfumer .
The fragrance or odor of plants is owing , in nearly all cases , to a perfectly volatile oil , either contained in small vessels , or sacs within them , or generated from time to time , during their life , as when in blossom .
Some few exude , by incision , odoriferous gums , as benzoin , olibanum , myrrh , &amp; c . ; others give , by the same act , what are called balsams , which appear to be mixtures of an odorous oil and an inodorous gum .
Some of these balsams are procured in the country to which the plant is indigenous by boiling it in water for a time , straining , and then boiling again , or evaporating it down till it assumes the consistency of treacle .
In this latter way is balsam of Peru procured from the _ Myroxylon peruiferum _ , and the balsam of Tolu from the _ Myroxylon toluiferum _ .
Though their odors are agreeable , they are not much applied in perfumery for handkerchief use , but by some they are mixed with soap , and in England they are valued more for their medicinal properties than for their fragrance .
SECTION II .
&quot; Were not summer &apos;s distillations left A liquid prisoner , pent in walls of glass , Beauty &apos;s effect with beauty were bereft , Nor it , nor no remembrance what it was ; But flowers distilled , though they with winter meet , Leese but their show , their substance still lives sweet . &quot;
SHAKSPEARE .
The extensive flower farms in the neighborhood of Nice , Grasse , Montpellier , and Cannes , in France , at Adrianople ( Turkey in Asia ) , at Broussa and Uslak ( Turkey in Asia ) , and at Mitcham , in England , in a measure indicate the commercial importance of that branch of chemistry called perfumery .
British India and Europe consume annually , at the very lowest estimate , 150,000 gallons of perfumed spirits , under various titles , such as eau de Cologne , essence of lavender , esprit de rose , &amp; c . The art of perfumery does not , however , confine itself to the production of scents for the handkerchief and bath , but extends to imparting odor to inodorous bodies , such as soap , oil , starch , and grease , which are consumed at the toilette of fashion .
Some idea of the commercial importance of this art may be formed , when we state that one of the large perfumers of Grasse and Paris employs annually 80,000 lbs .
of orange flowers , 60,000 lbs .
of cassia flowers , 54,000 lbs .
of rose-leaves , 32,000 lbs .
of jasmine blossoms , 32,000 lbs .
of violets , 20,000 lbs .
of tubereuse , 16,000 lbs .
of lilac , besides rosemary , mint , lemon , citron , thyme , and other odorous plants in large proportion .
In fact , the quantity of odoriferous substances used in this way is far beyond the conception of those even used to abstract statistics .
To the chemical philosopher , the study of perfumery opens a book as yet unread ; for the practical perfumer , on his laboratory shelves , exhibits many rare essential oils , such as essential oil of the flower of the _ Acacia farnesiana _ , essential oil of violets , tubereuse , jasmine , and others , the compositions of which have yet to be determined .
The exquisite pleasure derived from smelling fragrant flowers would almost instinctively induce man to attempt to separate the odoriferous principle from them , so as to have the perfume when the season denies the flowers .
Thus we find the alchemists of old , torturing the plants in every way their invention could devise for this end ; and it is on their experiments that the whole art of perfumery has been reared .
Without recapitulating those facts which may be found diffused through nearly all the old authors on medical botany , chemistry , pharmacy , and works of this character , from the time of Paracelsus to Celnart , we may state at once the mode of operation adopted by the practical perfumer of the present day for preparing the various extracts or essences , waters , oils , pomades , &amp; c . , used in his calling .
The processes are divided into four distinct operations ; viz.-- 1 .
_ Expression _ ; 2 .
_ Distillation _ ; 3 .
_ Maceration _ ; 4 .
_ Absorption _ .
1 .
_ Expression _ is only adopted where the plant is very prolific in its volatile or essential oil , -- _ i.e. _ its odor ; such , for instance , as is found in the pellicle or outer peel of the orange , lemon , and citron , and a few others .
In these cases , the parts of the plant containing the odoriferous principle are put sometimes in a cloth bag , and at others by themselves into a press , and by mere mechanical force it is squeezed out .
The press is an iron vessel of immense strength , varying in size from six inches in diameter , and twelve deep , and upwards , to contain one hundred weight or more ; it has a small aperture at the bottom to allow the expressed material to run for collection ; in the interior is placed a perforated false bottom , and on this the substance to be squeezed is placed , covered with an iron plate fitting the interior ; this is connected with a powerful screw , which , being turned , forces the substance so closely together , that the little vessels containing the essential oils are burst , and it thus escapes .
The common tincture press is indeed a model of such an instrument .
The oils which are thus collected are contaminated with watery extracts , which exudes at the same time , and from which it has to be separated ; this it does by itself in a measure , by standing in a quiet place , and it is then poured off and strained .
&#91; Illustration : Pipette to draw off small portions of otto from water . &#93;
2 .
_ Distillation . _ --The plant , or part of it , which contains the odoriferous principle , is placed in an iron , copper , or glass pan , varying in size from that capable of holding from one to twenty gallons , and covered with water ; to the pan a dome-shaped lid is fitted , terminating with a pipe , which is twisted corkscrew fashion , and fixed in a bucket , with the end peeping out like a tap in a barrel .
The water in the still--for such is the name of the apparatus--is made to boil ; and having no other exit , the steam must pass through the coiled pipe ; which , being surrounded with cold water in the bucket , condenses the vapor before it can arrive at the tap .
With the steam , the volatile oils-- _ i.e. _ perfume--rises , and is liquefied at the same time .
The liquids which thus run over , on standing for a time , separate into two portions , and are finally divided with a funnel having a stopcock in the narrow part of it .
By this process , the majority of the volatile or essential oils are procured .
In some few instances alcohol-- _ i.e. _ rectified spirit of wine--is placed upon the odorous materials in lieu of water , which , on being distilled , comes away with the perfuming substance dissolved in it .
But this process is now nearly obsolete , as it is found more beneficial to draw the oil or essence first with water , and afterwards to dissolve it in the spirit .
The low temperature at which spirit boils , compared with water , causes a great loss of essential oil , the heat not being sufficient to disengage it from the plant , especially where seeds such as cloves or caraway are employed .
It so happens , however , that the finest odors , the _ recherché _ as the Parisians say , cannot be procured by this method ; then recourse is had to the next process .
&#91; Illustration : Tap funnel for separating ottos from water and spirits from oil . &#93;
3 .
_ Maceration . _ --Of all the processes for procuring the perfumes of flowers , this is the most important to the perfumer , and is the least understood in England ; as this operation yields not only the most exquisite essences indirectly , but also nearly all those fine pomades known here as &quot; French pomatums , &quot; so much admired for the strength of fragrance , together with &quot; French oils &quot; equally perfumed .
The operation is conducted thus : --For what is called pomade , a certain quantity of purified mutton or deer suet is put into a clean metal or porcelain pan , this being melted by a steam heat ; the kind of flowers required for the odor wanted are carefully picked and put into the liquid fat , and allowed to remain from twelve to forty-eight hours ; the fat has a particular affinity or attraction for the oil of flowers , and thus , as it were , draws it out of them , and becomes itself , by their aid , highly perfumed ; the fat is strained from the spent flowers , and fresh are added four or five times over , till the pomade is of the required strength ; these various strengths of pomatums are noted by the French makers as Nos.
6 , 12 , 18 , and 24 , the higher numerals indicating the amount of fragrance in them .
For perfumed oils the same operation is followed ; but , in lieu of suet , fine olive oil or oil of ben , derived from the ben nuts of the Levant , is used , and the same results are obtained .
These oils are called &quot; Huile Antique &quot; of such and such a flower .
When neither of the foregoing processes gives satisfactory results , the method of procedure adopted is by , -- 4 .
_ Absorption _ , or _ Enfleurage . _ --The odors of some flowers are so delicate and volatile , that the heat required in the previously named processes would greatly modify , if not entirely spoil them ; this process is , therefore , conducted cold , thus : --Square frames , about three inches deep , with a glass bottom , say two feet wide and three feet long , are procured ; over the glass a layer of fat is spread , about half an inch thick , with a kind of plaster knife or spatula ; into this the flower buds are stuck , cup downwards , and ranged completely over it , and there left from twelve to seventy-two hours .
Some houses , such as that of Messrs. Pilar and Sons ; Pascal Brothers ; H. Herman , and a few others , have 3000 such frames at work during the season ; as they are filled , they are piled one over the other , the flowers are changed so long as the plants continue to bloom , which now and then exceeds two or three months .
For oils of the same plants , coarse linen cloths are imbued with the finest olive oil or oil of ben , and stretched upon a frame made of iron ; on these the flowers are laid and suffered to remain a few days .
This operation is repeated several times , after which the cloths are subjected to great pressure , to remove the now perfumed oil .
As we cannot give any general rule for working , without misleading the reader , we prefer explaining the process required for each when we come to speak of the individual flower or plant .
SECTION III .
Whenever a Still is named , or an article is said to be distilled or &quot; drawn , &quot; it must be understood to be done so by steam apparatus , as this is the only mode which can be adopted for obtaining anything like a delicate odor ; the old plan of having the fire immediately under the still , conveying an empyreumatic or burnt smell to the result , has become obsolete in every well-regulated perfumatory .
The steam-still differs from the one described only in the lower part , or pan , which is made double , so as to allow steam from a boiler to circulate round the pan for the purpose of boiling the contents , instead of the direct fire .
In macerating , the heat is applied in the same way , or by a contrivance like the common glue-pot , as made use of nowadays .
This description of apparatus will be found very useful for experiments which we will suggest by-and-by .
The perfumes for the handkerchief , as found in the shops of Paris and London , are either simple or compound ; the former are called extracts , _ extraits _ , _ esprits _ , or essences , and the latter _ bouquets _ and nosegays , which are mixtures of the extracts so compounded in quantity that no one flower or odor can be discovered as predominating over another ; and when made of the delicate-scented flowers carefully blended , they produce an exquisite sensation on the olfactory nerve , and are therefore much prized by all who can afford to purchase them .
We shall first explain the mode for obtaining the simple extracts of flowers .
This will be followed by the process for preparing ambergris , musk , and civet , substances , which , though of animal origin , are of the utmost importance as forming a large part in the most approved bouquets ; and we shall conclude this department of the art with recipes for all the fashionable bouquets and nosegays , the value of which , we doubt not , will be estimated according to the labor bestowed upon their analysis .
In order to render the work more easy of consultation , we have adopted the alphabetical arrangement in preference to a more scientific classification .
Among the collection of ottos of the East India Company at the Exhibition of 1851 , were several hitherto unknown in this country , and possessing much interest .
It is to be regretted , that no person having any practical knowledge of perfumery was placed on the jury of Class IV or XXIX .
Had such been the case , the desires of the exhibitors would probably have been realized , and European perfumers benefited by the introduction of new odors from the East .
Some of the ottos sent by a native perfumer of Benares were deemed worthy of honorable mention .
Such as _ Chumeylee _ , _ Beyla _ , _ Begla _ , _ Moteya _ , and many others from the Moluccas , but without any information respecting them .
We are not going to speak of , perhaps , more than a tithe of the plants that have a perfume--only those will be mentioned that are used by the operative perfumer , and such as are imitated by him in consequence of there being a demand for the article , which circumstances prevent him from obtaining in its genuine state .
The first that comes under our notice is-- ALLSPICE.--The odoriferous principle of allspice , commonly called pimento , is obtained by distilling the dried fruit , before it is quite ripe , of the _ Eugenia pimenta _ and _ Myrtus pimenta _ with water .
It is thus procured as an essential oil ; it is but little used in perfumery , and when so , only in combination with other spice oils ; for scenting soap it is , however , very agreeable , and much resembles the smell of cloves , and deserves more attention than it has hitherto received .
Mixed in the proportion of two ounces of oil of allspice with one gallon of rectified spirit of wine , it forms what may be termed extract of allspice , which extract will be found very useful in the manufacture of low-priced bouquets .
ALMONDS .
&quot; Mark well the flow &apos;ring almonds in the wood ; If od &apos;rous blooms the bearing branches load , The glebe will answer to the sylvan reign , Great heats will follow , and large crops of grain . &quot;
VIRGIL .
This perfume has been much esteemed for many ages .
It may be procured by distilling the leaves of any of the laurel tribe , and the kernels of stone fruit ; for trade purposes , it is obtained from the bitter almonds , and exists in the skin or pellicle that covers the seed after it is shelled .
In the ordinary way , the almonds are put into the press for the purpose of obtaining the mild or fat oil from the nut ; the cake which is left after this process is then mixed with salt and water , and allowed to remain together for about twenty-four hours prior to distillation .
The reason for moistening the cake is well understood to the practical chemist , and although we are not treating the subject of perfumery in a chemical sense , but only in a practical way , it may not be inappropriate here to observe , that the essential oil of almonds does not exist ready formed to any extent in the nut , but that it is produced by a species of fermentation , from the amygdalin and emulsine contained in the almonds , together with the water that is added .
Analogous substances exist in laurel leaves , and hence the same course is to be pursued when they are distilled .
Some manufacturers put the moistened cake into a bag of coarse cloth , or spread it upon a sieve , and then force the stream through it ; in either case , the essential oil of the almond rises with the watery vapor , and is condensed in the still-worm .
In this concentrated form , the odor of almonds is far from agreeable ; but when diluted with spirit , in the proportion of about one and a half ounce of the oil to a gallon of spirit or alcohol , it is very pleasant .
&#91; Illustration : Almond . &#93;
The essential oil of almonds , enters into combination with soap , cold cream , and many other materials prepared by the perfumer ; for which see their respective titles .
Fourteen pounds of the cake yield about one ounce of essential oil .
In experiments with this substance , it must be carefully remembered that it is exceedingly _ poisonous _ , and , therefore , great caution is necessary in its admixture with substances used as a cosmetic , otherwise dangerous results may ensue .
_ Artificial Otto of Almonds . _ --Five or six years ago , Mr. Mansfield , of Weybridge , took out a patent for the manufacture of otto of almonds from benzole .
( Benzole is obtained from tar oil . )
His apparatus , according to the Report of the juries of the 1851 Exhibition , consists of a large glass tube in the form of a coil , which at the upper end divides into two tubes ; each of which is provided with a funnel .
A stream of nitric acid flows slowly into one of the funnels , and benzole into the other .
The two substances meet at the point of union of the tubes , and a combination ensues with the evolution of heat .
As the newly formed compound flows down through the coil it becomes cool , and is collected at the lower extremity ; it then requires to be washed with water , and lastly with a dilute solution of carbonate of soda , to render it fit for use .
Nitro-benzole , which is the chemical name for this artificial otto of almonds , has a different odor to the true otto of almonds , but it can nevertheless be used for perfuming soap .
Mr. Mansfield writes to me under date of January 3d , 1855 : -- &quot; In 1851 , Messrs. Gosnell , of Three King Court , began to make this perfume under my license ; latterly I withdrew the license from them by their consent , and since then it is not made that I am aware of . &quot;
It is , however , quite common in Paris .
ANISE.--The odorous principle is procured by distilling the seeds of the plant _ Pimpinella anisum _ ; the product is the oil of aniseed of commerce .
As it congeals at a temperature of about 50 ° Fahr . , it is frequently adulterated with a little spermaceti , to give a certain solidity to it , whereby other cheaper essential oils can be added to it with less chance of detection .
As the oil of aniseed is quite soluble in spirit , and the spermaceti insoluble , the fraud is easily detected .
This perfume is exceedingly strong , and is , therefore , well adapted for mixing with soap and for scenting pomatums , but does not do nicely in compounds for handkerchief use .
BALM , oil of Balm , called also oil of Melissa , is obtained by distilling the leaves of the _ Melissa officinalis _ with water ; it comes from the still tap with the condensed steam or water , from which it is separated with the tap funnel .
But it is very little used in perfumery , if we except its combination in _ Aqua di Argento _ .
BALSAM.--Under this title there are two or three substances used in perfumery , such as balsam of Peru , balsam of Tolu , and balsam of storax ( also called liquid amber ) .
The first-named , is procured from the _ Myroxylon peruiferum _ ; it exudes from the tree when wounded , and is also obtained by boiling down the bark and branches in water .
The latter is the most common method for procuring it .
It has a strong odor , like benzoin .
Balsam of Tolu flows from the _ Toluifera balsammum _ .
It resembles common resin ( rosin ) ; with the least warmth , however , it runs to a liquid , like brown treacle .
The smell of it is particularly agreeable , and being soluble in alcohol makes a good basis for a bouquet , giving in this respect a permanence of odor to a perfume which the simple solution of an oil would not possess .
For this purpose all these balsams are very useful , though not so much used as they might be .
&quot; ULEX has found that balsam of Tolu is frequently adulterated with common resin .
To detect this adulteration he pours sulphuric acid on the balsam , and heats the mixture , when the balsam dissolves to a cherry-red fluid , without evolving sulphurous acid , but with the escape of benzoic or cinnamic acid , if no common resin is present .
On the contrary , the balsam foams , blackens , and much sulphurous acid is set free , if it is adulterated with common resin . &quot;
-- _ Archives der Pharmacie _ .
Balsam of storax , commonly called gum styrax , is obtained in the same manner , and possessing similar properties , with a slight variation of odor , is applicable in the same manner as the above .
They are all imported from South America , Chili , and Mexico , where the trees that produce them are indigenous .
BAY , oil of sweet Bay , also termed essential oil of laurel-berries , is a very fragrant substance , procured by distillation from the berries of the bay laurel .
Though very pleasant , it is not much used .
BERGAMOT.--This most useful perfume is procured from the _ Citrus Bergamia _ , by expression from the peel of the fruit .
It has a soft sweet odor , too well known to need description here .
When new and good it has a greenish-yellow tint , but loses its greenness by age , especially if kept in imperfectly corked bottles .
It then becomes cloudy from the deposit of resinous matter , produced by the contact of the air , and acquires a turpentine smell .
It is best preserved in well-stoppered bottles , kept in a cool cellar , and in the dark ; light , especially the direct sunshine , quickly deteriorates its odor .
This observation may be applied , indeed , to all perfumes , except rose , which is not so spoiled .
When bergamot is mixed with other essential oils it greatly adds to their richness , and gives a sweetness to spice oils attainable by no other means , and such compounds are much used in the most highly scented soaps .
Mixed with rectified spirit in the proportions of about four ounces of bergamot to a gallon , it forms what is called &quot; extract of bergamot , &quot; and in this state is used for the handkerchief .
Though well covered with extract of orris and other matters , it is the leading ingredient in Bayley and Blew &apos;s Ess .
Bouquet ( see BOUQUETS ) .
&#91; Illustration : Styrax Benzoin . &#93;
BENZOIN , also called Benjamin.--This is a very useful substance to perfumers .
It exudes from the _ Styrax benzoin _ by wounding the tree , and drying , becomes a hard gum-resin .
It is principally imported from Borneo , Java , Sumatra , and Siam .
The best kind comes from the latter place , and used to be called Amygdaloides , because of its being interspersed with several white spots , which resemble broken almonds .
When heated , these white specks rise as a smoke , which is easily condensed upon paper .
The material thus separated from the benzoin is called flowers of benzoin in commerce , and by chemists is termed benzoic acid .
It has all , or nearly all , the odor of the resin from which it is derived .
The extract , or tincture of benzoin , forms a good basis for a bouquet .
&#91; B &#93; Like balsam of Tolu , it gives permanence and body to a perfume made with an essential oil in spirit .
The principal consumption of benzoin is in the manufacture of pastilles ( see PASTILLES ) , and for the preparation of fictitious vanilla pomade ( see POMATUMS ) .
CARAWAY.--This odoriferous principle is drawn by distillation from the seeds of the _ Carum carui _ .
It has a very pleasant smell , quite familiar enough without description .
It is well adapted to perfume soap , for which it is much used in England , though rarely if ever on the continent ; when dissolved in spirit it may be used in combination with oil of lavender and bergamot for the manufacture of cheap essences , in a similar way to cloves ( see CLOVES ) .
If caraway seeds are ground , they are well adapted for mixing to form sachet powder ( see SACHETS ) .
CASCARILLA.--The bark is used in the formation of pastilles , and also enters into the composition known as _ Eau à Bruler _ , for perfuming apartments , to which we refer .
The bark alone of this plant is used by the manufacturing perfumer , and that only in the fabrication of pastilles .
The _ Cascarilla gratissimus _ is however so fragrant , that according to Burnett its leaves are gathered by the Koras of the Cape of Good Hope as a perfume , and both the _ C.
fragrans _ and _ C.
fragilis _ are odoriferous .
It behooves perfumers , therefore , who are on the look out for novelties , to obtain these leaves and ascertain the result of their distillation .
Messrs.
Herring and Co . , some years ago , drew the oil of cascarilla , but it was only offered to the trade as a curiosity .
CASSIA.--The essential oil of cassia is procured by distilling the outer bark of the _ Cinnamomum cassia _ .
1 cwt .
of bark yields rather more than three quarters of a pound of oil ; it has a pale yellow color ; in smell it much resembles cinnamon , although very inferior to it .
It is principally used for perfuming soap , especially what is called &quot; military soap , &quot; as it is more aromatic or spicy than flowery in odor ; it therefore finds no place for handkerchief use .
CASSIE.-- &quot; The short narcissus and fair daffodil , Pansies to please the sight , and _ cassie _ sweet to swell . &quot;
DRYDEN &apos;S _ Virgil _ .
This is one of those fine odors which enters into the composition of the best handkerchief bouquets .
&#91; Illustration : Flower-buds of the Acacia Farnesiana . &#93;
When smelled at alone , it has an intense violet odor , and is rather sickly sweet .
It is procured by maceration from the _ Acacia farnesiana _ .
The purified fat is melted , into which the flowers are thrown and left to digest for several hours ; the spent flowers are removed , and fresh are added , eight or ten times , until sufficient richness of perfume is obtained .
As many flowers are used as the grease will cover , when they are put into it , in a liquid state .
After being strained , and the pomade has been kept at a heat sufficient only to retain its liquidity , all impurities will subside by standing for a few days .
Finally cooled , it is the cassie pomade of commerce .
The _ Huile de Cassie _ , or fat oil of cassie , is prepared in a similar manner , substituting the oil of Egyptian ben nut , olive oil , or almond oil , in place of suet .
Both these preparations are obviously only a solution of the true essential oil of cassie flowers in the neutral fatty body .
Europe may shortly be expecting to import a similar scented pomade from South Australia , derived from the Wattle , a plant that belongs to the same genus as the _ A.
farnesiana _ , and which grows most luxuriantly in Australia .
Mutton fat being cheap , and the wattle plentiful , a profitable trade may be anticipated in curing the flowers , &amp; c . To prepare the extract of cassie , take six pounds of No .
24 ( best quality ) cassie pomade , and place upon it one gallon of the best rectified spirit , as sent out by Bowerbank , of Bishopsgate .
After it has digested for three weeks or a month , at a summer heat , it is fit to draw from the pomatum , and , if good , has a beautiful green color and rich flowery smell of the cassie blossom .
All extracts made by this process-- _ maceration _ , or , as it may be called , cold _ infusion _ , give a more natural smell of the flowers to the result , than by merely dissolving the essential oil ( procured by distillation ) in the spirit ; moreover , where the odor of the flower exists in only very minute quantities , as in the present instance , and with violet , jasmine , &amp; c . , it is the only practical mode of proceeding .
In this , and all other similar cases , the pomatum must be cut up into very small pieces , after the domestic manner of &quot; chopping suet , &quot; prior to its being infused in the alcohol .
The action of the mixture is simply a change of place in the odoriferous matter , which leaves the fat body by the superior attraction , or affinity , as the chemists say , of the spirits of wine , in which it freely dissolves .
The major part of the extract can be poured or drawn off the pomatum without trouble , but it still retains a portion in the interstices , which requires time to drain away , and this must be assisted by placing the pomatum in a large funnel , supported by a bottle , in order to collect the remainder .
Finally , all the pomatum , which is now called _ washed pomatum _ , is to be put into a tin , which tin must be set into hot water , for the purpose of melting its contents ; when the pomatum thus becomes liquefied , any extract that is still in it rises to the surface , and can be skimmed off , or when the pomatum becomes cold it can be poured from it .
The washed pomatum is preserved for use in the manufacture of dressing for the hair , for which purpose it is exceedingly well adapted , on account of the purity of the grease from which it was originally prepared , but more particularly on account of a certain portion of odor which it still retains ; and were it not used up in this way , it would be advisable to put it for a second infusion in spirit , and thus a weaker extract could be made serviceable for lower priced articles .
I cannot leave cassie without recommending it more especially to the notice of perfumers and druggists , as an article well adapted for the purpose of the manufacture of essences for the handkerchief and pomades for the hair .
When diluted with other odors , it imparts to the whole such a true flowery fragrance , that it is the admiration of all who smell it , and has not a little contributed to the great sale which certain proprietary articles have attained .
We caution the inexperienced not to confound cassie with cassia , which has a totally different odor .
See ACACIA POMADE .
CEDAR WOOD now and then finds a place in a perfumer &apos;s warehouse ; when ground , it does well to form a body for sachet powder .
Slips of cedar wood are sold as matches for lighting lamps , because while burning an agreeable odor is evolved ; some people use it also , in this condition , distributed among clothes in drawers to &quot; prevent moth . &quot;
On distillation it yields an essential oil that is exceedingly fragrant .
Messrs. Rigge and Co . , of London , use it extensively for scenting soap .
LEBANON CEDAR WOOD .
( _ For the Handkerchief . _ ) Otto of cedar , 1 oz .
Rectified spirit , 1 pint .
Esprit rose trip , 1 / 4 pint .
The tincture smells agreeably of the wood , from which it can readily be made .
Its crimson color , however , prohibits it from being used for the handkerchief .
It forms an excellent tincture for the teeth , and is the basis of the celebrated French dentifrice &quot; eau Botot . &quot;
CEDRAT.--This perfume is procured from the rind of the citron fruit ( _ Citrus medica _ ) , both by distillation and expression ; it has a very beautiful lemony odor , and is much admired .
It is principally used in the manufacture of essences for the handkerchief , being too expensive for perfuming grease or soap .
What is called extract of cedrat is made by dissolving two ounces of the above essential oil of citron in one pint of spirits , to which some perfumers add half an ounce of bergamot .
CINNAMON.--Several species of the plant _ Laurus cinnamomum _ yield the cinnamon and cassia of commerce .
Its name is said to be derived from _ China Amomum _ , the bark being one of the most valued spices of the East .
Perfumers use both the bark and the oil , which is obtained by distillation from it .
The ground bark enters into the composition of some pastilles , tooth powders , and sachets .
The essential oil of cinnamon is principally brought to this country from Ceylon ; it is exceedingly powerful , and must be used sparingly .
In such compounds as cloves answer , so will cinnamon .
CITRON.--On distilling the flowers of the _ Citrus medica _ , a very fragrant oil is procured , which is a species of neroli , and is principally consumed by the manufacturers of eau de Cologne .
CITRONELLA.--Under this name there is an oil in the market , chiefly derived from Ceylon and the East Indies ; its true origin we are unable to decide ; in odor it somewhat resembles citron fruit , but is very inferior .
Probably it is procured from one of the grasses of the _ Andropogon _ genus .
Being cheap , it is extensively used for perfuming soap .
What is now extensively sold as &quot; honey &quot; soap , is a fine yellow soap slightly perfumed with this oil .
Some few use it for scenting grease , but it is not much admired in that way .
CLOVES.--Every part of the clove plant ( _ Caryophyllus aromaticus _ ) abounds with aromatic oil , but it is most fragrant and plentiful in the unexpanded flower-bud , which are the cloves of commerce .
Cloves have been brought into the European market for more than 2000 years .
The plant is a native of the Moluccas and other islands in the China seas .
&quot; The average annual crop of cloves , &quot; says Burnett , &quot; is , from each tree , 2 or 2-1 / 2 lbs . , but a fine tree has been known to yield 125 lbs .
of this spice in a single season , and as 5000 cloves only weigh one pound , there must have been at least 625,000 flowers upon this single tree . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Clove . &#93;
The oil of cloves may be obtained by expression from the fresh flower-buds , but the usual method of procuring it is by distillation , which is carried on to a very great extent in this country .
Few essential oils have a more extensive use in perfumery than that of cloves ; it combines well with grease , soap , and spirit , and , as will be seen in the recipes for the various bouquets given hereafter , it forms a leading feature in some of the most popular handkerchief essences , Rondeletia , the Guard &apos;s Bouquet , &amp; c . , and will be found where least expected .
For essence of cloves , dissolve oil of cloves in the proportion of two ounces of oil to one gallon of spirit .
DILL.--Perfumers are now and then asked for &quot; dill water ; &quot; it is , however , more a druggist &apos;s article than a perfumer &apos;s , as it is more used for its medicinal qualities than for its odor , which by the way , is rather pleasant than otherwise .
Some ladies use a mixture of half dill water and half rose water , as a simple cosmetic , &quot; to clear the complexion . &quot;
The oil of dill is procured by submitting the crushed fruit of dill ( _ Anethum graveolens _ ) with water to distillation .
The oil floats on the surface of the distillate , from which it is separated by the funnel in the usual manner ; after the separation of the oil , the &quot; water &quot; is fit for sale .
Oil of dill may be used with advantage , if in small proportions , and mixed with other oils , for perfuming soap .
EGLANTINE , or SWEET BRIAR , notwithstanding what the poet Robert Noyes says-- &quot; In fragrance yields , Surpassing citron groves or spicy fields , &quot; does not find a place in the perfumer &apos;s &quot; scent-room &quot; except in name .
This , like many other sweet-scented plants , does not repay the labor of collecting its odor .
The fragrant part of this plant is destroyed more or less under every treatment that it is put to , and hence it is discarded .
As , however , the article is in demand by the public , a species of fraud is practised upon them , by imitating it thus : -- IMITATION EGLANTINE , OR ESSENCE OF SWEET BRIAR .
Spirituous extract of French rose pomatum , 1 pint . &quot;
&quot; cassie , 1 / 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; fleur d &apos;orange , 1 / 4 &quot; Esprit de rose , 1 / 4 &quot; Oil of neroli , 1 / 2 drachm .
Oil of lemon grass ( verbena oil ) , 1 / 2 &quot; ELDER ( _ Sambucus nigra _ ) .--The only preparation of this plant for its odorous quality used by the perfumer , is elder-flower water .
To prepare it , take nine pounds of elder-flowers , free from stalk , and introduce it to the still with four gallons of water ; the first three gallons that come over is all that need be preserved for use ; one ounce of rectified spirit should be added to each gallon of &quot; water &quot; distilled , and when bottled it is ready for sale .
Other preparations of elder flowers are made , such as milk of elder , extract of elder , &amp; c . , which will be found in their proper place under Cosmetics .
Two or three new materials made from this flower will also be given hereafter , which are likely to meet with a very large sale on account of the reputed cooling qualities of the ingredients ; of these we would call attention more particularly to cold cream of elder-flowers , and to elder oil for the hair .
The preparations of elder-flowers , if made according to the Pharmacopoeias , are perfectly useless , as the forms therein given show an utter want of knowledge of the properties of the materials employed .
FENNEL ( _ Foeniculum vulgare _ ) .--Dried fennel herb , when ground , enters into the composition of some sachet powders .
The oil of fennel , in conjunction with other aromatic oils , may be used for perfuming soap .
It is procurable by distillation .
FLAG ( SWEET ) ( _ Acorus calamus _ ) .--The roots , or rhizome , of the sweet flag , yield by distillation a pleasant-smelling oil ; 1 cwt .
of the rhizome will thus yield one pound of oil .
It can be used according to the pleasure of the manufacturer in scenting grease , soap , or for extracts , but requires other sweet oils with it to hide its origin .
GERANIUM ( _ Pelargonium odoratissimum _ , rose-leaf geranium ) .--The leaves of this plant yield by distillation a very agreeable rosy-smelling oil , so much resembling real otto of rose , that it is used very extensively for the adulteration of that valuable oil , and is grown very largely for that express purpose .
It is principally cultivated in the south of France , and in Turkey ( by the rose-growers ) .
In the department of <unk> , at <unk> , in France , hundreds of acres of it may be seen growing .
1 cwt .
of leaves will yield about two ounces of essential oil .
<unk> to adulterate otto of rose , it is in its turn itself adulterated with <unk> grass oil ( _ Andropogon _ ) , and thus formerly was very difficult to procure genuine ; on account of the increased cultivation of the plant , it is now , however , easily procured pure .
Some samples are <unk> , others nearly white , but we prefer that of a brownish tint .
When dissolved in rectified spirit , in the proportion of about six ounces to the gallon , it forms the &quot; extract of rose-leaf geranium &quot; of the shops .
A word or two is necessary about the oil of geranium , as much <unk> is created respecting it , in consequence of there being an oil under the name of geranium , but which in reality is derived from the _ Andropogon <unk> _ , cultivated in the Moluccas .
This said andropogon ( geranium ! )
oil can be used to adulterate the true geranium , and hence we suppose its nomenclature in the <unk> markets .
The genuine rose-leaf geranium oil <unk> about 6 _ s . _ per ounce , while the andropogon oil is not worth more than that sum per pound .
And we may observe here , that the perfuming essential oils are best purchased through the wholesale perfumers , as from the nature of their trade they have a better knowledge and means of obtaining the real article than the <unk> .
On account of the pleasing odor of the true oil of rose-leaf geranium , it is a valuable article for perfuming many materials , and appears to give the public great satisfaction .
<unk> by maceration or enfleurage with clarified fat , we may obtain this fine odor from the flowers of the _ Heliotrope <unk> _ or _ H.
<unk> _ .
<unk> as the odor of this plant is , at present it is not applied to use by the manufacturing perfumer .
This we think rather a singular fact , especially as the perfume is powerful and the flowers abundant .
We should like to hear of some experiments being tried with this plant for procuring its odor in this country , and for that purpose now suggest the mode of operation which would most likely lead to successful results .
For a small <unk> in the first instance , which can be <unk> by any person having the run of a garden , we will say , procure an ordinary glue-pot now in common use , which melts the material by the boiling of water ; it is in fact a water-bath , in chemical <unk> capable of holding a pound or more of melted fat .
At the season when the flowers are in bloom , obtain half a pound of fine mutton suet , melt the suet and strain it through a close <unk> , allow the liquefied fat , as it <unk> from the sieve , to drop into cold spring water ; this operation <unk> and <unk> the blood and membrane from it .
In order to start with a perfectly inodorous grease , the melting and <unk> process may be repeated three or four times ; finally , <unk> the fat and cast it into a pan to free it from adhering water .
Now put the clarified suet into the macerating pot , and place it in such a position near the fire of the <unk> , or elsewhere that will keep it warm enough to be liquid ; into the fat throw as many flowers as you can , and there let them remain for twenty-four hours ; at this time strain the fat from the spent flowers and add fresh ones ; repeat this operation for a week : we <unk> at the last straining the fat will have become very highly perfumed , and when cold may be <unk> termed _ Pomade à la Heliotrope _ .
The cold pomade being <unk> up , like suet for a <unk> , is now to be put into a <unk> bottle , and covered with spirits as highly rectified as can be obtained , and left to digest for a week or more ; the spirit then strained off will be highly perfumed ; in reality it will be _ extract of Heliotrope _ , a delightful perfume for the handkerchief .
The <unk> of the operation is simple enough : the fat body has a strong affinity or attraction for the odorous body , or essential oil of the flowers , and it therefore absorbs it by contact , and becomes itself perfumed .
In the second operation , the spirit has a much greater attraction for the fragrant principle than the fatty matter ; the former , therefore , becomes perfumed at the expense of the latter .
The same experiment may be repeated with almond oil <unk> for the fat .
The experiment here <unk> at , may be varied with any flowers that there are to <unk> ; indeed , by having the macerating bath larger than was mentioned above , an excellent _ <unk> _ pomade and essence might be produced from every <unk> in the kingdom , and thus we may receive another <unk> from the cultivation of flowers beyond their beauty of form and color .
We hope that those of our readers who feel inclined to <unk> experiments of this nature will not be <unk> by <unk> , &quot; they are not worth the trouble . &quot;
It must be remembered , that very fine essences realize in the London perfumery <unk> 16 _ s . _ per pint of 16 ounces , and that fine _ <unk> _ pomades <unk> the same sum per pound .
If the experiments are successful they should be published , as then we may hope to establish a new and important manufacture in this country .
But we are <unk> .
The odor of heliotrope resembles a mixture of almonds and vanilla , and is well imitated thus : -- EXTRACT OF HELIOTROPE .
Spirituous extract of vanilla , 1 / 2 pint . &quot;
&quot; French rose pomatum , 1 / 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; orange-flower pomatum , 2 oz . &quot;
&quot; ambergris , 1 oz .
Essential oil of almonds , 5 drops .
A preparation made in this manner under the name of _ Extract de Heliotrope _ is that which is sold in the shops of Paris and London , and is really a very nice perfume , passing well with the public for a genuine extract of heliotrope .
HONEYSUCKLE or <unk> : -- &quot; <unk> of flower the <unk> , pale and <unk> , But well <unk> her sickly looks With <unk> odors . &quot;
What the poet <unk> here says is quite true ; nevertheless , it is a flower that is not used in practical perfumery , though there is no reason for <unk> it .
The experiments suggested for obtaining the odor of Heliotrope and <unk> ( thousand flowers ) are also applicable to this , as also to <unk> .
A good IMITATION OF HONEYSUCKLE is made thus : -- Spirituous extract of rose pomatum , 1 pint . &quot;
