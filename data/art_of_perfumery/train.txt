DILL.--Perfumers are now and then asked for &quot; dill water ; &quot; it is , however , more a druggist &apos;s article than a perfumer &apos;s , as it is more used for its medicinal qualities than for its odor , which by the way , is rather pleasant than otherwise .
Some ladies use a mixture of half dill water and half rose water , as a simple cosmetic , &quot; to clear the complexion . &quot;
The oil of dill is procured by submitting the crushed fruit of dill ( _ Anethum graveolens _ ) with water to distillation .
The oil floats on the surface of the distillate , from which it is separated by the funnel in the usual manner ; after the separation of the oil , the &quot; water &quot; is fit for sale .
Oil of dill may be used with advantage , if in small proportions , and mixed with other oils , for perfuming soap .
EGLANTINE , or SWEET BRIAR , notwithstanding what the poet Robert Noyes says-- &quot; In fragrance yields , Surpassing citron groves or spicy fields , &quot; does not find a place in the perfumer &apos;s &quot; scent-room &quot; except in name .
This , like many other sweet-scented plants , does not repay the labor of collecting its odor .
The fragrant part of this plant is destroyed more or less under every treatment that it is put to , and hence it is discarded .
As , however , the article is in demand by the public , a species of fraud is practised upon them , by imitating it thus : -- IMITATION EGLANTINE , OR ESSENCE OF SWEET BRIAR .
Spirituous extract of French rose pomatum , 1 pint . &quot;
&quot; cassie , 1 / 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; fleur d &apos;orange , 1 / 4 &quot; Esprit de rose , 1 / 4 &quot; Oil of neroli , 1 / 2 drachm .
Oil of lemon grass ( verbena oil ) , 1 / 2 &quot; ELDER ( _ Sambucus nigra _ ) .--The only preparation of this plant for its odorous quality used by the perfumer , is elder-flower water .
To prepare it , take nine pounds of elder-flowers , free from stalk , and introduce it to the still with four gallons of water ; the first three gallons that come over is all that need be preserved for use ; one ounce of rectified spirit should be added to each gallon of &quot; water &quot; distilled , and when bottled it is ready for sale .
Other preparations of elder flowers are made , such as milk of elder , extract of elder , &amp; c . , which will be found in their proper place under Cosmetics .
Two or three new materials made from this flower will also be given hereafter , which are likely to meet with a very large sale on account of the reputed cooling qualities of the ingredients ; of these we would call attention more particularly to cold cream of elder-flowers , and to elder oil for the hair .
The preparations of elder-flowers , if made according to the Pharmacopoeias , are perfectly useless , as the forms therein given show an utter want of knowledge of the properties of the materials employed .
FENNEL ( _ Foeniculum vulgare _ ) .--Dried fennel herb , when ground , enters into the composition of some sachet powders .
The oil of fennel , in conjunction with other aromatic oils , may be used for perfuming soap .
It is procurable by distillation .
FLAG ( SWEET ) ( _ Acorus calamus _ ) .--The roots , or rhizome , of the sweet flag , yield by distillation a pleasant-smelling oil ; 1 cwt .
of the rhizome will thus yield one pound of oil .
It can be used according to the pleasure of the manufacturer in scenting grease , soap , or for extracts , but requires other sweet oils with it to hide its origin .
GERANIUM ( _ Pelargonium odoratissimum _ , rose-leaf geranium ) .--The leaves of this plant yield by distillation a very agreeable rosy-smelling oil , so much resembling real otto of rose , that it is used very extensively for the adulteration of that valuable oil , and is grown very largely for that express purpose .
It is principally cultivated in the south of France , and in Turkey ( by the rose-growers ) .
In the department of <unk> , at <unk> , in France , hundreds of acres of it may be seen growing .
1 cwt .
of leaves will yield about two ounces of essential oil .
<unk> to adulterate otto of rose , it is in its turn itself adulterated with <unk> grass oil ( _ Andropogon _ ) , and thus formerly was very difficult to procure genuine ; on account of the increased cultivation of the plant , it is now , however , easily procured pure .
Some samples are <unk> , others nearly white , but we prefer that of a brownish tint .
When dissolved in rectified spirit , in the proportion of about six ounces to the gallon , it forms the &quot; extract of rose-leaf geranium &quot; of the shops .
A word or two is necessary about the oil of geranium , as much <unk> is created respecting it , in consequence of there being an oil under the name of geranium , but which in reality is derived from the _ Andropogon <unk> _ , cultivated in the Moluccas .
This said andropogon ( geranium ! )
oil can be used to adulterate the true geranium , and hence we suppose its nomenclature in the <unk> markets .
The genuine rose-leaf geranium oil <unk> about 6 _ s . _ per ounce , while the andropogon oil is not worth more than that sum per pound .
And we may observe here , that the perfuming essential oils are best purchased through the wholesale perfumers , as from the nature of their trade they have a better knowledge and means of obtaining the real article than the <unk> .
On account of the pleasing odor of the true oil of rose-leaf geranium , it is a valuable article for perfuming many materials , and appears to give the public great satisfaction .
<unk> by maceration or enfleurage with clarified fat , we may obtain this fine odor from the flowers of the _ Heliotrope <unk> _ or _ H.
<unk> _ .
<unk> as the odor of this plant is , at present it is not applied to use by the manufacturing perfumer .
This we think rather a singular fact , especially as the perfume is powerful and the flowers abundant .
We should like to hear of some experiments being tried with this plant for procuring its odor in this country , and for that purpose now suggest the mode of operation which would most likely lead to successful results .
For a small <unk> in the first instance , which can be <unk> by any person having the run of a garden , we will say , procure an ordinary glue-pot now in common use , which melts the material by the boiling of water ; it is in fact a water-bath , in chemical <unk> capable of holding a pound or more of melted fat .
At the season when the flowers are in bloom , obtain half a pound of fine mutton suet , melt the suet and strain it through a close <unk> , allow the liquefied fat , as it <unk> from the sieve , to drop into cold spring water ; this operation <unk> and <unk> the blood and membrane from it .
In order to start with a perfectly inodorous grease , the melting and <unk> process may be repeated three or four times ; finally , <unk> the fat and cast it into a pan to free it from adhering water .
Now put the clarified suet into the macerating pot , and place it in such a position near the fire of the <unk> , or elsewhere that will keep it warm enough to be liquid ; into the fat throw as many flowers as you can , and there let them remain for twenty-four hours ; at this time strain the fat from the spent flowers and add fresh ones ; repeat this operation for a week : we <unk> at the last straining the fat will have become very highly perfumed , and when cold may be <unk> termed _ Pomade Ã  la Heliotrope _ .
The cold pomade being <unk> up , like suet for a <unk> , is now to be put into a <unk> bottle , and covered with spirits as highly rectified as can be obtained , and left to digest for a week or more ; the spirit then strained off will be highly perfumed ; in reality it will be _ extract of Heliotrope _ , a delightful perfume for the handkerchief .
The <unk> of the operation is simple enough : the fat body has a strong affinity or attraction for the odorous body , or essential oil of the flowers , and it therefore absorbs it by contact , and becomes itself perfumed .
In the second operation , the spirit has a much greater attraction for the fragrant principle than the fatty matter ; the former , therefore , becomes perfumed at the expense of the latter .
The same experiment may be repeated with almond oil <unk> for the fat .
The experiment here <unk> at , may be varied with any flowers that there are to <unk> ; indeed , by having the macerating bath larger than was mentioned above , an excellent _ <unk> _ pomade and essence might be produced from every <unk> in the kingdom , and thus we may receive another <unk> from the cultivation of flowers beyond their beauty of form and color .
We hope that those of our readers who feel inclined to <unk> experiments of this nature will not be <unk> by <unk> , &quot; they are not worth the trouble . &quot;
It must be remembered , that very fine essences realize in the London perfumery <unk> 16 _ s . _ per pint of 16 ounces , and that fine _ <unk> _ pomades <unk> the same sum per pound .
If the experiments are successful they should be published , as then we may hope to establish a new and important manufacture in this country .
But we are <unk> .
The odor of heliotrope resembles a mixture of almonds and vanilla , and is well imitated thus : -- EXTRACT OF HELIOTROPE .
Spirituous extract of vanilla , 1 / 2 pint . &quot;
&quot; French rose pomatum , 1 / 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; orange-flower pomatum , 2 oz . &quot;
&quot; ambergris , 1 oz .
Essential oil of almonds , 5 drops .
A preparation made in this manner under the name of _ Extract de Heliotrope _ is that which is sold in the shops of Paris and London , and is really a very nice perfume , passing well with the public for a genuine extract of heliotrope .
HONEYSUCKLE or <unk> : -- &quot; <unk> of flower the <unk> , pale and <unk> , But well <unk> her sickly looks With <unk> odors . &quot;
What the poet <unk> here says is quite true ; nevertheless , it is a flower that is not used in practical perfumery , though there is no reason for <unk> it .
The experiments suggested for obtaining the odor of Heliotrope and <unk> ( thousand flowers ) are also applicable to this , as also to <unk> .
A good IMITATION OF HONEYSUCKLE is made thus : -- Spirituous extract of rose pomatum , 1 pint . &quot;
&quot; violet &quot; 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; tubereuse &quot; 1 &quot; Extract of vanilla , 1 / 4 &quot; &quot; Tolu , 1 / 4 &quot; Otto neroli , 10 drops . &quot;
almonds , 5 &quot; The <unk> cost of a perfume made in this manner would probably be too high to meet the demand of a retail druggist ; in such cases it may be diluted with rectified spirit to the extent &quot; to make it pay , &quot; and will yet be a nice perfume .
The formula generally given herein for odors is in <unk> that when bottled they will retail for at least <unk> the fluid ounce !
which is the average price put on the finest perfumery by the manufacturers of London and Paris .
<unk> perfume under this name is sold to a limited extent , but if it did not smell better than the plant _ Hovenia <unk> _ or _ H.
<unk> _ , a native of Japan , it would not sell at all .
The article in the market is made thus : -- Rectified spirit , 1 quart .
Rose-water , 1 / 2 pint .
Otto lemons , 1 / 2 oz .
Otto of rose , 1 drachm . &quot;
cloves , 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; neroli , 10 drops .
First dissolve the ottos in the spirit , then add the rose-water .
After filtration it is ready for sale .
When compounds of this kind do not become bright by passing through <unk> , the addition of a little carbonate of magnesia prior to filtering <unk> <unk> them .
The water in the above recipe is only added in order that the article produced may be retailed at a moderate price , and would , of course , be better without that &quot; universal friend . &quot;
<unk> &quot; <unk> above all , The jasmine <unk> wide her elegant <unk> . &quot;
This flower is one of the most prized by the perfumer .
Its odor is delicate and sweet , and so peculiar that it is without comparison , and as such cannot be imitated .
When the flowers of the _ <unk> odoratissimum _ are distilled , repeatedly using the water of distillation over fresh flowers , the essential oil of jasmine may be procured .
It is , however , exceedingly rare , on account of the enormous cost of production .
There was a fine sample of six ounces exhibited in the <unk> department of the Crystal Palace , the price of which was 9 _ l . _ the fluid ounce !
The plant is the <unk> of the <unk> , from which our name is derived .
In the perfumer &apos;s laboratory , the method of obtaining the odor is by absorption , or , as the French term it , _ enfleurage _ ; that is , by spreading a mixture of pure lard and suet on a glass <unk> , and <unk> the <unk> flowers all over it , leaving them to stand a day or so , and repeating the operation with fresh <unk> grease absorbs the odor .
Finally , the pomade is scraped off the glass or slate , melted at as low a temperature as possible , and strained .
Oils strongly impregnated with the fragrance are also prepared much in the same way .
<unk> of cotton wool , previously steeped in oil of ben ( obtained by pressure from the blanched nuts of the _ Moringa <unk> _ ) are covered with jasmine flowers , which is repeated several times ; finally , the cotton or linen cloths which some perfumers use , are squeezed under a press .
The jasmine oil thus produced is the _ Huile <unk> au jasmin _ of the French houses .
The &quot; extract of jasmine &quot; is prepared by pouring rectified spirit on the jasmine pomade or oil , and allowing them to remain together for a fortnight at a summer heat .
The best quality extract requires two pounds of pomatum to every quart of spirit .
The same can be done with the oil of jasmine .
If the pomade is used , it must be cut up fine previously to being put into the spirit ; if the oil is used , it must be shaken well together every two or more hours , otherwise , on account of its specific gravity , the oil separates , and but little surface is exposed to the spirit .
After the extract is strained off , the &quot; washed &quot; pomatum or oil is still useful , if remelted , in the composition of pomatum for the hair , and gives more satisfaction to a customer than any of the &quot; <unk> and <unk> , &quot; &amp; c . &amp; c . , made up and scented with essential oils ; the one smells of the flower , the other &quot; a <unk> . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : Jasmine . &#93;
The extract of jasmine enters into the composition of a great many of the most approved handkerchief perfumes sold by the English and French perfumers .
Extract of jasmine is sold for the handkerchief often pure , but is one of those scents which , though very gratifying at first , becomes what people call &quot; sickly &quot; after exposure to the oxidizing influence of the air , but if <unk> mixed with other perfumes of an opposite character is sure to please the most <unk> customer .
<unk> scent of the jonquil is very beautiful ; for perfumery purposes it is however but little cultivated in comparison with jasmine and tubereuse .
It is prepared exactly as jasmine .
The Parisian perfumers sell a mixture which they call &quot; extract of jonquil . &quot;
The plant , however , only <unk> the part of a <unk> to the <unk> , giving it its name .
The so-called jonquil is made thus : -- Spirituous extract of jasmine pomade , 1 pint . &quot;
&quot; tubereuse &quot; 1 &quot; &quot; &quot; fleur d &apos;orange , 1 / 2 &quot; Extract of vanilla , 2 fluid ounces .
<unk> distillation from the berries of the _ Laurus <unk> _ , and from the leaves of the _ Laurus <unk> _ , an oil and perfumed water are procurable of a very beautiful and fragrant character .
<unk> , however , it is <unk> , as from the similarity of odor to the oil distilled from the bitter almond , it is rarely , if ever , used by the perfumer , the latter being more economical .
<unk> climate of England appears to be better adapted for the perfect development of this fine old favorite perfume than any other on the <unk> .
&quot; The ancients , &quot; says Burnett , &quot; employed the flowers and the leaves to <unk> their baths , and to give a sweet scent to water in which they washed ; hence the <unk> name of the plant , _ Lavandula _ . &quot;
Lavender is grown to an enormous extent at Mitcham , in Surrey , which is the <unk> of its production , in a commercial point of view .
Very large quantities are also grown in France , but the fine odor of the British produce <unk> in the market four times the price of that of <unk> growth .
Burnett says that the oil of _ Lavandula spica _ is more pleasant than that derived from the other species , but this statement must not <unk> the <unk> to <unk> the French spike lavender , as it is not worth a <unk> of that derived from the _ <unk> <unk> _ .
<unk> weight of good lavender flowers yield , by distillation , from 14 to 16 oz .
of essential oil .
All the inferior <unk> of oil of lavender are used for perfuming soaps and greases ; but the best , that obtained from the Mitcham lavender , is entirely used in the manufacture of what is called lavender water , but which , more properly , should be called essence or extract of lavender , to be in keeping with the nomenclature of other essences prepared with spirit .
The number of formulÃ¦ published for making a liquid perfume of lavender is almost <unk> , but the whole of them may be <unk> into essence of lavender , simple ; essence of lavender , compound ; and lavender water .
There are two methods of making essence of lavender : <unk> .
By distilling a mixture of essential oil of lavender and rectified spirit ; and the <unk> .
By merely mixing the oil and the spirit together .
The first process yields the finest quality : it is that which is adopted by the firm of <unk> and <unk> , <unk> reputation for this article is such that it gives a good character in foreign markets , especially India , to all products of lavender of English manufacture .
Lavender essence , that which is made by the still , is quite white , while that by mixture only always has a <unk> tint , which by age becomes <unk> and resinous .
<unk> &apos;S LAVENDER .
To produce a very fine distillate , <unk> Otto of English Lavender , 4 oz .
Rectified spirit ( 60 over proof ) , 5 pints .
Rose-water , 1 pint .
Mix and distil five pints for sale .
Such essence of lavender is expensive , but at 10 _ s . _ a pint of 14 oz !
there _ is _ a <unk> for profit .
It not being convenient to the general <unk> to sell distilled lavender essence , the following form , by mixture , will produce a <unk> article , and nearly as white as the above .
ESSENCE OF LAVENDER .
Otto of lavender , 3-1 / 2 oz .
Rectified spirit , 2 quarts .
The perfumer &apos;s retail price for such quality is 8 _ s . _ per pint of 14 oz .
Many perfumers and druggists in making lavender water or essence , use a small portion of bergamot , with an idea of <unk> its <unk> very erroneous opinion ; moreover , such lavender quickly <unk> .
LAVENDER <unk> : English oil of lavender , 4 oz .
Spirit , 3 quarts .
Rose-water , 1 pint .
Filter as above , and it is ready for sale .
COMMON LAVENDER <unk> form as the above , substituting French lavender for the British .
<unk> for Rondeletia , Lavender Bouquet , and other lavender compounds , will be given when we come to speak of compound perfumes , which will be reserved until we have finished explaining the method of making the simple essences .
<unk> fine perfume is abstracted from the _ Citrus <unk> _ , by expression , from the rind of the fruit .
The otto of lemons in the market is principally from <unk> , where there are hundreds of acres of &quot; lemon groves . &quot;
Otto of lemons , like all the ottos of the Citrus family , is rapidly prone to oxidation when in contact with air and exposure to light ; a high temperature is also detrimental , and as such is the case it should be preserved in a cool cellar .
Most of the samples from the <unk> shelves of the druggists &apos; shops , are as much like essence of turpentine , to the smell , as that of lemons ; rancid oil of lemons may , in a great measure , be purified by agitation with warm water and final <unk> .
When new and good , lemon otto may be freely used in combination with rosemary , cloves , and caraway , for perfuming powders for the <unk> .
From its rapid oxidation , it should not be used for perfuming grease , as it assists rather than otherwise all fats to turn rancid ; hence pomatums so perfumed will not keep well .
In the manufacture of other compound perfumes , it should be dissolved in spirit , in the proportion of six to eight ounces of oil to one gallon of spirit .
There is a large consumption of otto of lemons in the manufacture of Eau de Cologne ; that <unk> uses it is easily discovered by adding a few drops of Liq .
AmmoniÃ¦ <unk> .
to half an ounce of his Eau de Cologne , the smell of the lemon is thereby brought out in a remarkable manner .
Perhaps it is not out of place here to <unk> , that in attempts to discover the composition of certain perfumes , we are greatly assisted by the use of strong Liq .
AmmoniÃ¦ .
<unk> of the essential oils <unk> with the Ammonia , allow those which do not do so , if present in the compound , to be <unk> .
<unk> <unk> to Pereira , the otto in the market under this name is derived from the _ Andropogon schoenanthus _ a species of grass which grows <unk> in India .
It is cultivated to a large extent in Ceylon and in the Moluccas <unk> for the otto , which from the plant is easily procured by distillation .
<unk> grass otto , or , as it is sometimes called , oil of verbena , on account of its similarity of odor to that favorite plant , is imported into this country in old English <unk> and <unk> bottles .
It is very powerful , well adapted for perfuming soaps and greases , but its principal consumption is in the manufacture of artificial essence of verbena .
From its comparatively low price , great strength , and fine perfume ( when diluted ) , the lemon grass otto may be much more used than at present , with considerable advantage to the retail <unk> .
<unk> fragrance of the flowers of this ornamental shrub is well known .
The essence of lilac is obtained either by the process of maceration , or enfleurage with grease , and afterwards treating the pomatum thus formed with rectified spirit , in the same manner as previously described for cassie ; the odor so much resembles tubereuse , as to be frequently used to adulterate the latter , the demand for tubereuse being at all times greater than the supply .
A beautiful IMITATION OF ESSENCE OF WHITE <unk> may be compounded thus : -- Spirituous extract from tubereuse pomade , 1 pint . &quot;
of orange-flower pomade , 1 / 4 &quot; Otto of almonds , 3 drops .
Extract of civet , 1 / 2 oz .
The civet is only used to give permanence to the perfume of the handkerchief .
<unk> manufacturing perfumer <unk> the advice of the <unk> writer , to &quot; consider the lilies of the field . &quot;
<unk> as they are in odor , they are not cultivated for their perfume .
If lilies are thrown into oil of sweet almonds , or ben oil , they impart to it their sweet smell ; but to obtain anything like fragrance , the infusion must be repeated a dozen times with the same oil , using fresh flowers for each infusion , after standing a day or so .
The oil being shaken with an equal quantity of spirit for a week , gives up its odor to the alcohol , and thus extract of lilies _ may _ be made .
But how it _ is _ made is thus : -- IMITATION &quot; <unk> OF THE <unk> . &quot;
Extract of tubereuse , 1 / 2 pint . &quot;
jasmine , 1 oz . &quot;
fleur d &apos;orange , 2 oz . &quot;
vanilla , 3 oz . &quot;
cassie , 1 / 4 pint . &quot;
rose , 1 / 4 &quot; Otto of almonds , 3 drops .
<unk> this mixture together for a month , and then bottle it for sale .
It is a perfume that is very much admired .
<unk> <unk> is used in the manufacture of some of those scented powders called <unk> .
A strong-smelling essential oil may be procured from it by distillation , but it is rarely used .
<unk> perfume of this flower is <unk> ; practically , however , it is of little use to the manufacturer , the large size of the blossoms and their comparative scarcity prevents their being used , but a very excellent imitation of its odor is made as under , and is that which is found in the perfumers &apos; shops of London and Paris .
IMITATION &quot; ESSENCE OF <unk> . &quot;
Spirituous extract of orange-flower pomatum , 1 pint . &quot;
&quot; rose pomatum , 2 pints . &quot;
&quot; tubereuse pomatum , 1 / 2 pint . &quot;
&quot; violet pomatum , 1 / 2 &quot; Essential oil of citron , 3 <unk> . &quot;
&quot; almonds , 10 drops .
<unk> otto procured by distilling _ Origanum <unk> _ , commonly called oil of oringeat by the French , is exceedingly powerful , and in this respect resembles all the ottos from the different species of thyme , of which the marjoram is one .
One hundred weight of the dry herb yields about ten ounces of the otto .
<unk> oil is extensively used for perfuming soap , but more in France than in England .
It is the chief ingredient used by <unk> <unk> , of Paris , for scenting their &quot; <unk> <unk> Soap , &quot; so common in the London shops .
<unk> <unk> sweet-smelling otto can be produced by distilling the _ <unk> <unk> _ , but it is not used by perfumers .
<unk> .
See BALM .
<unk> for the exquisite odor of this little flower , it would scarcely be known otherwise than as a weed .
Sweet as it is in its natural state , and prolific in odor , we are not able to maintain its characteristic smell as an essence .
Like many others , during separation from the plant , the fragrance is more or less modified ; though not perfect , it still reminds the sense of the odor of the flowers .
To give it that sweetness which it appears to want , a certain quantity of violet is added to bring it up to the market odor .
As this plant is so very prolific in odor , we think something might be done with it in England , especially as it <unk> as well in this country as in France ; and we desire to see Flower <unk> and organized <unk> established in the British <unk> , for the extraction of essences and the manufacture of pomade and oils , of such flowers as are indigenous , or that <unk> in the open fields of our country .
Besides <unk> up a new field of enterprise and good <unk> for capital , it would give healthy employment to many women and <unk> .
<unk> air employment for the young is of no little consideration to maintain the stamina of the future <unk> ; for it cannot be <unk> that our <unk> <unk> and confined <unk> are <unk> to the physical condition of the human family .
To return from our <unk> .
The essence of <unk> , or , as it is more often sold under the name of Extrait de <unk> , is prepared by infusing the <unk> pomade in rectified spirit , in the proportion of one pound of pomade to one pint of spirit , allowing them to digest together for a fortnight , when the essence is filtered off the pomade .
One ounce of extrait d <unk> is added to every pint .
This is done to give permanence to the odor upon the handkerchief , and does not in any way alter its odor .
<unk> French name for artificial essence of almond ( see ALMOND ) .
<unk> the _ <unk> _ yield fragrant ottos by distillation .
The otto of the <unk> ( _ M.
<unk> _ ) is exceedingly powerful , and very valuable for perfuming soap , in conjunction with other perfumes .
Perfumers use the ottos of the mint in the manufacture of <unk> and dental liquids .
The leading ingredient in the celebrated &quot; eau Botot &quot; is oil of peppermint in alcohol .
A good imitation may be made thus : -- EAU DE BOTOT .
Tincture of cedar wood , 1 pint . &quot;
myrrh , 1 oz .
Oil of peppermint , 1 / 2 dr . &quot; <unk> mint , 1 / 4 dr . &quot; cloves , 10 drops . &quot;
roses , 10 &quot; <unk> of this formula can be readily suggested , but the main object is to retain the mint ottos , as they have more power than any other aromatic to overcome the smell of tobacco .
<unk> , it must be remembered , are as much used for <unk> the mouth after smoking as for a dentifrice .
<unk> very fragrant otto may be procured by distilling both flowers and leaves of the common myrtle ; one hundred-weight will yield about five ounces of the volatile oil .
The demand for essence of myrtle being very limited , the odor as found in the perfumers &apos; shops is very rarely a genuine article , but it is imitated thus : -- IMITATION ESSENCE OF <unk> .
Extract of vanilla , 1 / 2 pint . &quot;
roses 1 &quot; Extract of fleur d &apos;orange , 1 / 2 pint . &quot;
tubereuse , 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; jasmine , 2 oz .
Mix and allow to stand for a fortnight : it is then fit for bottling , and is a perfume that gives a great deal of satisfaction .
<unk> water is sold in France under the name of eau d <unk> , and may be prepared like rose , elder , or other flower waters .
NEROLI , OR <unk> distinct odors are procurable from the orange-blossom , varying according to the methods adopted for procuring them .
This difference of perfume from the same flower is a great advantage to the manufacturer .
This curious fact is worthy of inquiry by the chemical philosopher .
It is not peculiar to the orange-flower , but applies to many others , especially <unk> to all flowers .
When orange-flowers are treated by the maceration process , that is , by infusion in a fatty body , we procure orange-flower pomatum , its strength and quality being regulated by the number of <unk> of the flower made in the same grease .
By digesting this orange-flower pomatum in rectified spirits in the proportions of from six pounds to eight pounds of pomade to a gallon of spirit , for about a fortnight at a summer heat , we obtain the extrait de fleur d &apos;orange , or extract of orange-flowers , a handkerchief perfume <unk> by none .
In this state its odor resembles the original so much , that with closed eyes the best <unk> could not distinguish the scent of the extract from that of the flower .
The peculiar flowery odor of this extract renders it valuable to perfumers , not only to sell in a pure state , but slightly modified with other _ extraits _ passes for &quot; sweet pea , &quot; &quot; <unk> , &quot; &amp; c . , which it slightly resembles in fragrance .
&#91; Illustration : Orange . &#93;
Now , when orange-flowers are distilled with water , we procure the otto of the blossom , which is known commercially as oil of neroli .
The neroli procured from the flowers of the Citrus <unk> is considered to be the finest quality , and is called &quot; neroli petale . &quot;
The next quality , &quot; neroli bigarade , &quot; is derived from the blossoms of the _ Citrus <unk> _ , or <unk> orange .
Another quality , which is considered inferior to the preceding , is the neroli petit grain , obtained by distilling the leaves and the young unripe fruit of the different species of the <unk> .
The &quot; petale &quot; and &quot; bigarade &quot; neroli are used to an enormous extent in the manufacture of eau de Cologne and other handkerchief perfumes .
The petit grain is mainly consumed for scenting soap .
To form the esprit de neroli , dissolve 1-1 / 2 oz .
of neroli petale in one gallon of rectified spirits .
Although very agreeable , and extensively used in the manufacture of bouquets , it has no relation to the flowery odor of the extrait de fleur d &apos;orange , as derived from the same flowers by maceration ; in fact , it has as different an odor as though obtained from another plant , yet in theory both these _ extraits _ are but alcoholic solutions of the otto of the flower .
The water used for distillation in procuring the neroli , when well freed from the oil , is imported into this country under the name of eau de fleur d &apos;orange , and may be used , like elder-flower and rose-water , for the skin , and as an eye <unk> .
It is remarkable for its fine fragrance , and it is <unk> that it is not more used , being moderate in price .
( See _ Syringa _ . )
<unk> beautiful odor of the nutmeg is familiar to all .
Though an otto can be drawn from them of a very fragrant character , it is rarely used in perfumery .
The ground nuts are , however , used advantageously in the combinations of scented powders used for scent <unk> &quot; <unk> &apos;s <unk> . &quot;
<unk> is a gum resin , used to a limited extent in this country , in the manufacture of incense and pastilles .
It is chiefly interesting as being one of those odoriferous bodies of which frequent mention is made in the Holy volume .
&#91; C &#93; &quot; It is believed , &quot; says Burnett , &quot; to have been one of the ingredients in the sweet incense of the Jews ; and it is still burnt as incense in the Greek and Romish churches , where the diffusion of such odors round the altar forms a part of the <unk> religious service . &quot;
Olibanum is partially soluble in alcohol , and , like most of the balsams , probably owes its perfume to a peculiar odoriferous body , associated with the benzoic acid it contains .
For making the tincture or extract of olibanum , take 1 pound of the gum to 1 gallon of the spirit .
<unk> the title &quot; Neroli &quot; we have already spoken of the odoriferous principle of the orange-blossom .
We have now to speak of what is known in the market as Essence of Orange , or , as it is more frequently termed , Essence of Portugal , <unk> name , however , which we cannot admit in a <unk> <unk> of the &quot; odors of plants . &quot;
The otto of orange-peel , or odoriferous principle of the orange fruit , is procured by expression and by distillation .
The peel is <unk> in order to crush the little vessels or sacs that <unk> the otto .
Its abundance in the peel is shown by <unk> a piece near the flame of a candle ; the otto that <unk> out <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
It has many uses in perfumery , and from its refreshing fragrance finds many admirers .
It is the leading ingredient in what is sold as &quot; <unk> Water &quot; and &quot; Eau de Portugal . &quot;
The following is a very useful form for preparing <unk> WATER .
Rectified spirit ( not less than 60 over proof ) , 1 gallon .
Otto of orange peel , 3 oz . &quot;
lemon peel , 3 oz . &quot;
rose 1 / 4 oz .
This is a form for EAU DE PORTUGAL .
Rectified spirit ( 60 over proof ) , 1 gallon .
Essential oil of orange peel , 6 oz . &quot;
lemon peel , 1 oz . &quot;
lemon grass , 1 / 4 oz . &quot;
bergamot , 1 oz . &quot;
otto of rose , 1 / 4 oz .
It should be noted that these perfumes are never to be filled into wet bottles , for if in any way damp from water , a minute portion of the ottos are separated , which gives an opalescent appearance to the mixture .
<unk> , all bottles should be _ spirit <unk> _ prior to being filled with any perfume , but especially with those containing essences of orange or lemon peel .
ORRIS , properly <unk> dried rhizome of _ Iris <unk> _ has a very pleasant odor , which , for the want of a better comparison , is said to resemble the smell of violets ; it is , however , exceedingly <unk> to the <unk> aroma of that modest flower when such <unk> <unk> are made .
Nevertheless the perfume of iris root is good , and well worthy of the place it has obtained as a perfuming substance .
The powder of orris root is very extensively used in the manufacture of sachet powders , <unk> , &amp; c . It <unk> that celebrated &quot; <unk> herb &quot; known as &quot; <unk> . &quot;
For tincture of orris , or , as the perfumers call it , EXTRACT OF ORRIS , Take orris root , crushed , 7 lbs .
Rectified spirits , 1 gallon .
After standing together for about a fortnight , the extract is fit to take off .
It requires considerable time to drain away , and , to prevent loss , the remainder of the orris should be placed in the tincture press .
This extract enters into the composition of many of the most celebrated bouquets , such as &quot; Jockey Club , &quot; and others , but is never sold alone , because its odor , although <unk> , is not sufficiently good to stand public opinion upon its own <unk> ; but in combination its value is very great ; possessing little aroma itself , yet it has the power of <unk> the odor of other fragrant bodies ; like the <unk> and <unk> , which though comparatively <unk> , readily fire <unk> bodies .
<unk> odor of palm <unk> fat oil of <unk> due to a fragrant principle which it contains .
By infusion in alcohol , the odoriferous body is dissolved , and resembles , to a certain extent , the tincture of orris , or of extract of violet , but is very indifferent , and is not likely to be brought into use , though several attempts have been made to render it of service when the cultivation of the violets have <unk> from bad seasons .
<unk> _ <unk> patchouly _ ( LINDLEY ) , _ <unk> <unk> _ ( <unk> ) , is an herb that grows extensively in India and China .
It somewhat resembles our garden sage in its growth and form , but the leaves are not so fleshy .
&#91; Illustration : Patchouly . &#93;
The odor of patchouly is due to an otto contained in the leaves and stems , and is readily procured by distillation .
1 cwt .
of good herb will yield about 28 oz .
of the essential oil , which is of a dark brown color , and of a density about the same as that of oil of sandal wood , which it resembles in its physical character .
Its odor is the most powerful of any derived from the botanic kingdom ; hence , if mixed in the proportion of measure for measure , it completely covers the smell of all other bodies .
EXTRACT OF PATCHOULY .
Rectified spirit , 1 gallon .
Otto of patchouly , 1-1 / 4 oz . &quot;
rose , 1 / 4 oz .
The essence of patchouly thus made is that which is found in the perfumers &apos; shops of Paris and London .
Although few perfumes have had such a fashionable run , yet when smelled at in its pure state , it is far from agreeable , having a kind of <unk> or <unk> odor , analogous to <unk> , or , as some say , it smells of &quot; old <unk> . &quot;
The characteristic smell of Chinese or Indian ink is due to some admixture of this herb .
The origin of the use of patchouly as a perfume in Europe is curious .
A few years ago real Indian shawls <unk> an extravagant price , and <unk> could always distinguish them by their odor ; in fact , they were perfumed with patchouly .
The French manufacturers had for some time successfully imitated the Indian fabric , but could not impart the odor .
At length they discovered the secret , and began to import the plant to perfume articles of their make , and thus palm off <unk> shawls as real Indian !
From this origin the perfumers have brought it into use .
Patchouly herb is extensively used for scenting drawers in which linen is kept ; for this purpose it is best to powder the leaves and put them into muslin sacks , covered with silk , after the manner of the old-fashioned <unk> .
In this state it is very <unk> in preventing the clothes from being attacked by <unk> .
Several combinations of patchouly will be given in the recipes for &quot; bouquets and nosegays . &quot;
PEA ( SWEET ) .--A very fine odor may be abstracted from the flowers of the <unk> by maceration in any fatty body , and then digesting the pomade produced in spirit .
It is , however , rarely manufactured , because a very close IMITATION OF THE ESSENCE OF SWEET PEA .
can be prepared thus : -- Extract of tuberose , 1 / 2 pint . &quot;
fleur d &apos;orange , 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; rose from pomatum , 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; vanilla , 1 oz .
<unk> , like sounds , appear to influence the olfactory nerve in certain definite degrees .
There is , as it were , an octave of odors like an octave in music ; certain odors <unk> , like the <unk> of an instrument .
Such as almond , heliotrope , vanilla , and <unk> blend together , each producing different degrees of a nearly similar impression .
Again , we have citron , lemon , orange-peel , and verbena , forming a higher octave of smells , which blend in a similar manner .
The metaphor is completed by what we are <unk> to call <unk> , such as rose and rose geranium for the half note ; <unk> grain , neroli , a black key , followed by fleur d &apos;orange .
<unk> we have <unk> , sandal-wood , and vitivert , and many others running into each other .
From the odors already known we may produce , by uniting them in proper proportion , the smell of almost any flower , except jasmine .
The odor of some flowers resembles others so nearly that we are almost <unk> to believe them to be the same thing , or , at least , if not evolved from the plant as such , to become so by the action of the <unk> .
It is known that some actually are identical in composition , although produced from totally different plants , such as camphor , turpentine , rosemary .
Hence we may presume that chemistry will sooner or later produce one from the other , for with many it is merely an atom of water or an atom of oxygen that causes the difference .
It would be a <unk> thing to produce otto of roses from oil of rosemary , or from the rose geranium oil , and theory indicates its possibility .
The essential oil of almonds in a bottle that contains a good deal of <unk> , and but a very little of the oil , spontaneously passes into another odoriferous body , benzoic acid ; which is seen in crystals to form over the dry parts of the <unk> .
This is a natural <unk> of this idea .
In giving the recipe for &quot; sweet pea &quot; as above , we form it with the impression that its odor resembles the orange-blossom , which similarity is <unk> nearer by the addition of the rose and tuberose .
The vanilla is used merely to give permanence to the scent on the handkerchief , and this latter body is <unk> in preference to extract of musk or ambergris , which would answer the same purpose of giving permanence to the more volatile ingredients ; because the vanilla <unk> the same key of the olfactory nerve as the orange-blossom , and thus no new idea of a different scent is brought about as the perfume dies off from the handkerchief .
When perfumes are not mixed upon this principle , then we hear that such and such a perfume becomes &quot; sickly &quot; or &quot; <unk> &quot; after they have been on the handkerchief a short time .
<unk> Dr. Hoffman and Dr. Lyon Playfair have fallen into some error in their <unk> with regard to the application of this odor in perfumery .
After various practical experiments conducted in a large perfumatory , we have come to the conclusion that it cannot be so applied , simply because when the essence of pine-apple is smelled at , the vapor produces an <unk> action of the <unk> , producing cough , when exceedingly dilute .
Even in the infinitesimal portions it still produces disagreeable <unk> of the <unk> , which , if prolonged , such as is expected if used upon a handkerchief , is followed by intense <unk> .
It is obvious , therefore , that the <unk> use of the essence of pine-apple ( butyric ether ) cannot be adapted with benefit to the manufacturing perfumer , although <unk> to the <unk> as a flavoring material .
What we have here said refers to the artificial essence of pine-apple , or butyrate of ethyloxide , which , if very much diluted with alcohol , resembles the smell of pine-apple , and hence its name ; but how far the same observations are applicable to the true essential oil from the fruit or <unk> of the pine-apple , remains to be seen _ when _ we procure it .
As the West Indian <unk> are now <unk> freely into the market , the day is probably not distant when <unk> experiments can be tried ; but hitherto it must be remembered our experiments have only been performed with a body _ resembling in smell _ the true essential oil of the fruit .
The physical action of all ethers upon the human body is quite sufficient to prevent their application in perfumery , however useful in <unk> , which it is understood has to deal with another of the senses , <unk> of smell , but of taste .
The commercial &quot; essence of pine-apple , &quot; or &quot; pine-apple oil , &quot; and &quot; jargonelle pear-oil , &quot; are admitted only to be _ labelled _ such , but really are certain organic acid ethers .
For the present , then , perfumers must only look on these bodies as so many <unk> in the &quot; <unk> of Science , &quot; which , for the present , are without practical application in his art .
<unk> _ <unk> Caryophyllus . _ --The clove pink emits a most fragrant odor , &quot; especially at night , &quot; says <unk> .
&quot; The lavish pink that scents the garden round , &quot; is not , however , at present applied in perfumery , except in name .

It is remarkable how very much this mixture resembles the odor of the flower , and the public never doubt its being the &quot; real thing . &quot;
<unk> rose-wood , the lignum of the _ <unk> <unk> _ , is distilled , a sweet-smelling oil is procured , resembling in some slight degree the fragrance of the rose , and hence its name .
At one time , that is , prior to the cultivation of the rose-leaf geranium , the <unk> from rose-wood and from the root of the _ <unk> <unk> _ ( <unk> ) , were principally drawn for the adulteration of real otto of roses , but as the geranium oil answers so much better , the oil of rhodium has fallen into <unk> , hence its comparative scarcity in the market at the present day , though our <unk> <unk> it well .
One cwt .
of wood yields about three ounces of oil .
Ground rose-wood is valuable as a basis in the manufacture of sachet powders for perfuming the <unk> .
The French have given the name jacaranda to rose-wood , under the idea that the plant called jacaranda by the <unk> yields it , which is not the case ; &quot; the same word has perhaps been the origin of <unk> , badly written . &quot; -- _ Burnett _ .

This <unk> of the garden loses not its <unk> in the perfuming world .
The oil of roses , or , as it is commonly called , the otto , or attar , of roses , is procured ( contrary to so many opposite statements ) simply by distilling the roses with water .
The otto , or attar , of rose of commerce is derived from the _ <unk> <unk> <unk> _ .
Very extensive rose farms exist at Adrianople ( Turkey in Europe ) ; at Broussa , now famous as the residence of <unk> ; and at Uslak ( Turkey in Asia ) ; also at Ghazepore , in India .
The <unk> in Turkey are principally the <unk> <unk> of the low countries of the Balkan , between <unk> , and <unk> , as far as <unk> , in <unk> , about 200 <unk> from Constantinople .
In good seasons , this <unk> yields <unk> ounces ; but in bad seasons only 20,000 to <unk> ounces of attar are obtained .
It is estimated that it requires at least 2000 rose blooms to yield one drachm of otto .
The otto slightly varies in odor from different <unk> ; many places <unk> an otto which <unk> more readily than others , and , therefore , this is not a sure <unk> of purity , though many consider it such .
That which was exhibited in the Crystal Palace of 1851 , as &quot; from Ghazepore , &quot; in India , obtained the <unk> .
&quot; <unk> of roses , made in <unk> , is considered superior to any other ; a <unk> not <unk> , as , according to <unk> , the flower is here produced of <unk> fragrance as well as beauty .
A large quantity of rose-water twice distilled is allowed to run off into an open vessel , placed over night in a cool running stream , and in the morning the oil is found floating on the surface in minute specks , which are taken off very carefully by means of a blade of <unk> .
When cool it is of a dark green color , and as hard as resin , not becoming liquid at a temperature about that of boiling water .
<unk> <unk> and <unk> pounds &apos; weight of leaves is required to produce one ounce of the attar . &quot;
-- _ Indian <unk> . _ Pure otto of roses , from its <unk> sweetness , has not many admirers ; when diluted , however , there is nothing to equal it in odor , especially if mixed in soap , to form rose soap , or in pure spirit , to form the esprit de rose .
The soap not allowing the perfume to evaporate very fast , we cannot be <unk> with the smell of the otto .
The finest preparation of rose as an odor is made at Grasse , in France .
Here the flowers are not treated for the otto , but are subjected to the process of maceration in fat , or in oil , as described under jasmine , heliotrope , &amp; c . The rose pomade thus made , if digested in alcohol , say 8 lbs .
of No .
24 Pomade to one gallon of spirit , yields an esprit de rose of the first order , very superior to that which is made by the addition of otto to spirit .
It is difficult to account for this difference , but it is sufficiently characteristic to form a distinct odor .
See the article on fleur d &apos;orange and neroli ( pp .
<unk> , <unk> ) , which have similar qualities , previously described .
The esprit de rose made from the French rose pomade is never sold retail by the perfumer ; he <unk> this to form part of his _ <unk> _ bouquets .
Some wholesale druggists have , however , been <unk> it now for some time to country <unk> , for them to form <unk> rose-water , which it does to great perfection .
Roses are cultivated to a large extent in England , near Mitcham , in Surrey , for perfumers &apos; use , to make rose-water .
In the season when <unk> crops can be got , which is about the end of <unk> , or the early part of July , they are gathered as soon as the <unk> is off , and sent to <unk> in sacks .
When they arrive , they are immediately spread out upon a cool <unk> : otherwise , if left in a <unk> , they heat to such an extent , in two or three hours , as to be quite spoiled .
There is no organic matter which so rapidly absorbs oxygen , and becomes heated spontaneously , as a mass of freshly gathered roses .
To preserve these roses , the London perfumers immediately <unk> them ; for this purpose , the leaves are separated from the <unk> , and to every <unk> of flowers , equal to about six pounds &apos; weight , one pound of common salt is thoroughly rubbed in .
The salt absorbs the water existing in the petals , and rapidly becomes <unk> , reducing the whole to a pasty mass , which is finally <unk> away in <unk> .
In this way they will keep almost any length of time , without the fragrance being seriously <unk> .
A good rose-water can be prepared by distilling 12 lbs .
of <unk> roses , and 2-1 / 2 gallons of water .
&quot; Draw &quot; off two gallons ; the product will be the <unk> rose-water of the shops .
The rose-water that is imported from the South of France is , however , very superior in odor to any that can be produced here .
As it is a <unk> product of the distillation of roses for procuring the attar , it has a richness of aroma which appears to be <unk> with <unk> roses .
There are four modifications of essence of rose for the handkerchief , which are the _ <unk> plus <unk> _ of the perfumer &apos;s art .
They are , <unk> de rose triple , essence of white of roses , essence of <unk> rose , and essence of moss rose .
The following are the recipes for their formation : -- <unk> DE ROSE <unk> .

SHAKSPEARE .
By distilling the _ <unk> officinalis _ a thin <unk> otto is procured , having the characteristic odor of the plant , which is more aromatic than sweet .
One cwt .
of the fresh herb yields about twenty-four ounces of oil .
Otto of rosemary is very extensively used in perfumery , especially in combination with other ottos for scenting soap .
Eau de Cologne cannot be made without it , and in the once famous &quot; Hungary water &quot; it is the leading ingredient .
The following is the composition of <unk> WATER .
Rectified alcohol , 1 gallon .
Otto of English rosemary , 2 oz . &quot;
lemon-peel , 1 oz . &quot;
balm ( _ Melissa _ ) , 1 oz . &quot;

Esprit de rose , 1 pint .
Extract of fleur d &apos;orange , 1 &quot; It is put up for sale in a similar way to eau de Cologne , and is said to take its name from one of the <unk> of Hungary , who is reported to have derived great benefit from a bath containing it , at the age of <unk> years .
There is no doubt that <unk> and <unk> , while speaking for any time , would derive great benefit from perfuming their handkerchief with Hungary water or eau de Cologne , as the rosemary they contain <unk> the mind to <unk> action , sufficient of the <unk> being <unk> by occasionally <unk> the face with the handkerchief <unk> with these &quot; waters . &quot;
Shakspeare giving us the key , we can understand how it is that such perfumes containing rosemary are universally said to be &quot; so refreshing ! &quot;

This is an old favorite with the lovers of scent ; it is the wood that possesses the odor .
The finest santal-wood grows in the <unk> of <unk> , and the Santal-wood <unk> , where it is extensively cultivated for the Chinese market .
In the religious ceremonies of the <unk> , <unk> , and Chinese , santal-wood is burned , by way of incense , to an extent almost beyond <unk> .
The _ <unk> _ <unk> plentifully in China , but the continued <unk> to the Buddahs have almost <unk> the plant from the Celestial Empire ; and such is the demand , that it is about to be cultivated in Western Australia , in the <unk> of a profitable return , which we doubt not will be realized ; England alone would consume <unk> the quantity it does were its price within the range of other perfuming substances .
The otto which exists in the santal-wood is readily procured by distillation ; 1 cwt .
of good wood will yield about 30 ounces of otto .
&#91; Illustration : Santal-wood . &#93;
The white <unk> , which is so common in India and China , <unk> into every organic matter that it comes across , appears to have no <unk> for santal-wood ; hence it is frequently made into <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &amp; c . This quality , together with its fragrance , renders it a valuable article to the <unk> of the East .
The otto of santal is <unk> dense , and is above all others <unk> in its appearance , and , when good , is of a dark <unk> color .
When dissolved in spirit , it enters into the composition of a great many of the old-fashioned bouquets , such as &quot; <unk> , &quot; and others , the formulÃ¦ of which will be given hereafter .
Perfumers thus make what is called EXTRAIT DE BOIS DE <unk> .
Rectified spirits , 7 pints .
Esprit de rose , 1 pint .
Essential oil , _ i.e. _ otto , of santal , 3 oz .
All those EXTRACTS , made by dissolving the otto in alcohol , are nearly white , or at least only slightly tinted by the color of the oil used .
When a perfumer has to impart a delicate _ odeur _ to a lady &apos;s _ <unk> _ , which in some instances costs &quot; no end of money , &quot; and is an object , at any cost , to retain <unk> , it behooves his reputation to sell an article that will not stain a delicate white fabric .
Now , when a perfume is made in a direct manner from any wood or herb , as tinctures are made , that is , by infusion in alcohol , there is obtained , besides the odoriferous substance , a solution of coloring and <unk> matter , which is exceedingly detrimental to its fragrance , besides seriously <unk> any <unk> handkerchief that it may be used upon ; and for this reason this latter method should never be adopted , except for use upon silk <unk> .
The odor of santal <unk> well with rose ; and hence , prior to the cultivation of rose-leaf geranium , it was used to adulterate otto of roses ; but is now but seldom used for that purpose .
By a &quot; <unk> &quot; error , santal is often printed &quot; sandal , &quot; and &quot; <unk> . &quot;
<unk> of the perfumers of Germany use a tincture of the wood of the _ Laurus sassafras _ in the manufacture of hair-washes and other nostrums ; but as , in our opinion , it has rather a &quot; <unk> &quot; smell than flowery , we cannot recommend the German recipes .
The _ Eau <unk> _ , notwithstanding , has some reputation as a <unk> , but is little else than a weak tincture of sassafras .
<unk> oil of lavender , which is procured from the _ Lavandula spica _ , is generally called oil of spike .
( See Lavender . )
<unk> and <unk> are used in perfumery in the same way as benzoin , namely , by solution in spirit as a tincture .
An ounce of tincture of storax , tolu , or benzoin , being added to a pound of any very volatile perfume , gives a degree of permanence to it , and makes it last longer on the handkerchief than it otherwise would : thus , when any perfume is made by the solution of an otto in spirit , it is usual to add to it a small portion of a substance which is less volatile , such as extract of musk , extract of vanilla , ambergris , storax , tolu , orris , vitivert , or benzoin ; the manufacturer using his judgment and <unk> as to which of these materials are to be employed , <unk> , of course , those which are most compatible with the odor he is making .
The power which these bodies have of &quot; fixing &quot; a volatile substance , renders them valuable to the perfumer , independent of their aroma , which is due in many cases to benzoic acid , slightly modified by an <unk> oil peculiar to each substance , and which is taken up by the alcohol , together with a portion of resin .
When the perfume is put upon a handkerchief , the most volatile bodies disappear first : thus , after the alcohol has evaporated , the odor of the ottos appear stronger ; if it contains any resinous body , the ottos are held in solution , as it were , by the resin , and thus retained on the fabric .
<unk> a perfume to be made of otto only , without any &quot; fixing &quot; substance , then , as the perfume &quot; dies away , &quot; the olfactory nerve , if tutored , will detect its composition , for it spontaneously <unk> itself , no two ottos having the same volatility : thus , make a mixture of rose , jasmine , and patchouly ; the jasmine predominates first , then the rose , and , lastly , the patchouly , which will be found hours after the others have <unk> .
<unk> flowers of the _ <unk> <unk> _ , or common garden syringa , have an intense odor resembling the orange-blossom ; so much so , that in America the plant is often termed &quot; <unk> orange . &quot;
A great deal of the pomatum sold as <unk> <unk> , Ã  la fleur d &apos;orange , by the manufacturers of Cannes , is nothing more than fine suet perfumed with syringa blossoms by the maceration process .
Fine syringa pomade could be made in England at a quarter the cost of what is paid for the so-called orange pomatum .
<unk> the different species of thyme , but more particularly the lemon thyme , the _ <unk> <unk> _ , as well as the <unk> , origanum , &amp; c . , yield by distillation fragrant ottos , that are extensively used by manufacturing perfumers for scenting soaps ; though well adapted for this purpose , they do not answer at all in any other combinations .
Both in grease and in spirit all these ottos impart an <unk> smell ( very naturally ) rather than a flowery one , and , as a consequence , they are not considered _ recherchÃ© _ .
When any of these herbs are dried and ground , they <unk> enter into the composition of sachet powders .
TONQUIN , or <unk> seeds of the _ <unk> odorata _ are the tonquin or _ <unk> _ beans of commerce .
When fresh they are exceedingly fragrant , having an intense odor of newly made hay .
The _ Anthoxanthum <unk> _ , or sweet-smelling vernal grass , to which new hay owes its odor , probably yields <unk> the same fragrant principle , and it is remarkable that both tonquin beans and vernal grass , while actually growing , are nearly scentless , but become rapidly aromatic when <unk> from the <unk> stock .
Chemically considered , tonquin beans are very interesting , containing , when fresh , a fragrant volatile otto ( to which their odor is principally due ) , benzoic acid , a fat oil and a neutral <unk> _ <unk> _ .
In perfumery they are valuable , as , when ground , they form with other bodies an excellent and permanent sachet , and by infusion in spirit , the tincture or extract of tonquin enters into a thousand of the compound essences ; but on account of its great strength it must be used with caution , otherwise people say your perfume is &quot; <unk> , &quot; owing to the predominance of the odor and its well-known use in the boxes of those who indulge in the <unk> dust .

<unk> of the most exquisite odors with which we are acquainted is obtained by _ enfleurage _ from the tuberose flower .

After standing for three weeks or a month at summer heat , and with frequent agitation , it is fit to draw off , and being strained through cotton wool , is ready either for sale or use in the manufacture of bouquets .
This essence of tuberose , like that of jasmine , is exceedingly volatile , and if sold in its pure state quickly &quot; <unk> off &quot; the handkerchief ; it is therefore necessary to add some fixing ingredient , and for this purpose it is best to use one ounce of extract of orris , or half an ounce of extract of vanilla , to every pint of tuberose .

In this state it is rarely sold for a perfume , but is consumed in the manufacture of compound odors , bouquets , or nosegays , as they are called .
Extract of Vanilla is also used largely in the manufacture of hair-washes , which are readily made by mixing the extract of vanilla with either rose , orange , elder , or rosemary water , and afterwards filtering .
We need scarcely mention , that vanilla is greatly used by cooks and confectioners for flavoring .
VERBENA , or <unk> scented species of this plant , the lemon verbena , _ <unk> <unk> _ ( Hooker ) , gives one of the finest perfumes with which we are acquainted ; it is well known as <unk> a delightful fragrance by merely <unk> the hand over the plant ; some of the little vessels or sacks containing the otto must be crushed in this act , as there is little or no odor by merely smelling at the plant .
The otto , which can be extracted from the leaves by distillation with water , on account of its high price , is scarcely , if ever , used by the manufacturing perfumer , but it is most successfully imitated by mixing the otto of lemon grass , _ Andropogon schoenanthus _ , with rectified spirit , the odor of which resembles the former to a nicety .
The following is a good form for making the EXTRACT OF VERBENA .
Rectified spirit , 1 pint .
Otto of lemon grass , 3 drachms . &quot;
lemon peel , 2 oz . &quot;
orange peel , 1 / 2 oz .
After standing together for a few hours and then filtering , it is fit for sale .
Another mixture of this kind , presumed by the public to be made from the same plant , but of a finer quality , is composed <unk> is sold under the title EXTRAIT DE <unk> .
Rectified spirit , 1 pint .
Otto of orange peel , 1 oz . &quot;
lemon peel , 2 oz . &quot;
citron , 1 drachm . &quot;
lemon grass , 2-1 / 2 drachms .
Extrait de fleur d &apos;orange , 7 oz . &quot;
&quot; tubereuse , 7 oz .
Esprit de rose , 1 / 2 pint .
This mixture is exceedingly refreshing , and is one of the most elegant perfumes that is made .
Being white , it does not stain the handkerchief .
It is best when sold fresh made , as by age the citrine oils <unk> , and the perfume acquires an ethereal odor , and then customers say &quot; it is sour . &quot;
The vervaine thus prepared enters into the composition of a great many of the favorite bouquets that are sold under the title &quot; Court Bouquet , &quot; and others which are mixtures of violet , rose , and jasmine , with verbena or vervaine in different proportions .
In these preparations , as also in Eau de Portugal , and in fact where any of the citrine ottos are used , a much finer product is obtained by using grape spirit or brandy in preference to the English corn spirit as a <unk> for them .
Nor do they <unk> so quickly in French spirit as in English .
Whether this be due to the oil of wine ( oeanthic ether ) or not we cannot say , but think it is so .
<unk> &quot; The forward violet thus did I <unk> : Sweet <unk> , whence <unk> thou <unk> thy sweet that smells , If not from my <unk> &apos;s <unk> ? &quot;
The perfume <unk> by the _ Viola odorata _ is so universally admired , that to speak in its <unk> would be more than <unk> .
The demand for the &quot; essence of violets &quot; is far greater than the manufacturing perfumers are at present able to supply , and as a consequence , it is difficult to procure the genuine article through the ordinary sources of trade .
<unk> violet is , however , sold by many of the retail perfumers of the West End of London , but at a price that prohibits its use except by the <unk> or extravagant <unk> of fashion .
The violet farms from whence the flowers are procured to make this perfume are very extensive at Nice and Grasse , also in the neighborhood of <unk> .
The true smelling principle or otto of violets has never yet been isolated : a very concentrated solution in alcohol <unk> the olfactory nerve with the idea of the presence of <unk> acid , which is probably a true impression .
Burnett says that the plant _ Viola <unk> _ ( heart &apos;s ease ) , when bruised , smells like <unk> kernels , and doubtless , therefore , contains prussic acid .
The flowers of the heart &apos;s ease are scentless , but the plant evidently contains a principle which in other species of the Viola , is eliminated as the &quot; sweet that smells &quot; so beautifully <unk> to by Shakspeare .
For commercial purposes , the odor of the violet is procured in combination with spirit , oil , or suet , precisely according to the methods previously described for obtaining the aroma of some other flowers before mentioned , such as those for cassie , jasmine , orange-flower , namely , by maceration , or by _ enfleurage _ , the former method being principally adopted , followed by , when &quot; essence &quot; is required , digesting the pomade in rectified alcohol .
Good essence of violets , thus made , is of a beautiful green color , and , though of a rich deep tint , has no power to stain a white fabric , and its odor is perfectly natural .
The essence of violet , as prepared for retail sale , is thus made , according to the quality and strength of the pomade : --Take from six to eight pounds of the violet pomade , <unk> it up fine , and place it into one gallon of perfectly clean ( free from fusel oil ) rectified spirit , allow it to digest for three weeks or a month , then strain off the essence , and to every pint thereof add three ounces of tincture of orris root , and three ounces of esprit de cassie ; it is then fit for sale .
We have often seen displayed for sale in druggists &apos; shops plain tincture of orris root , done up in nice bottles , with <unk> upon them <unk> the contents to be &quot; Extract of Violet ; &quot; customers thus once &quot; taken in &quot; are not likely to be so a second time .
A good IMITATION ESSENCE OF <unk> is best prepared thus-- Spirituous extract of cassie pomade , 1 pint .
Esprit de rose , from pomade , 1 / 2 &quot; Tincture of orris , 1 / 2 &quot; Spirituous extract of tuberose pomade , 1 / 2 &quot; Otto of almonds , 3 drops .
After filtration it is fit for bottling .
In this mixture , it is the extract of cassie which has the leading smell , but modified by the rose and tuberose becomes very much like the violet .
Moreover , it has a green color , like the extract of violet ; and as the eye <unk> the judgment by the sense of taste , so it does with the sense of smell .
Extract of violet enters largely into the composition of several of the most popular bouquets , such as extract of spring flowers and many others .
VITIVERT , or <unk> , is the rhizome of an Indian grass .
In the neighborhood of <unk> , and in the city , this material has an extensive use by being manufactured into <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> , called <unk> .
During the hot seasons an <unk> <unk> water over them ; this operation cools the apartment by the evaporation of the water , and , at the same time , perfumes the atmosphere , in a very agreeable manner , with the odoriferous principle of the vitivert .
It has a smell between the aromatic or spicy odor and that of <unk> such a distinction can be admitted .
We <unk> it with orris root , not that it has any odor resembling it , but because it has a like effect in use in perfumery , and because it is prepared as a tincture for obtaining its odor .
About four pounds of the dried vitivert , as it is imported , being cut small and set to steep in a gallon of rectified spirits for a fortnight , produces the ESSENCE OF VITIVERT of the shops .
In this state it is rarely used as a perfume , although it is occasionally asked for by those who , perhaps , have <unk> to admire its odor by their previous residence in &quot; the Eastern <unk> . &quot;
The extract , essence , or tincture of vitivert , enters into the composition of several of the <unk> and old bouquets manufactured in the early days of perfumery in England , such as &quot; _ <unk> des Indies _ , &quot; for which preparation M. Delcroix , in the <unk> of his <unk> , created quite a _ furor _ in the fashionable world .
&#91; Illustration : Vitivert . &#93;
Essence of vitivert is also made by dissolving 2 oz .
of otto of vitivert in 1 gallon of spirit ; this preparation is stronger than the tincture , as above .
MARECHALE and BOUQUET DU ROI , perfumes which have also &quot; had their day , &quot; owe much of their <unk> to the vitivert contained in them .
<unk> of vitivert are sold for perfuming linen and preventing moth , and , when ground , is used to manufacture certain sachet powders .
Otto of vitivert is procurable by distillation ; a hundred-weight of vitivert yields about 14 oz .
of otto , which in appearance very much resembles otto of santal .
I have placed a sample of it in the <unk> at Kew .
<unk> exquisite perfume is sold under this name , presumed , of course , to be derived from the _ Volkameria inermis _ ( LINDLEY ) .
Whether it has a smell resembling the flower of that plant , or whether the plant blooms at all , we are unable to say .
It is a native of India , and seems to be little known even in the botanic <unk> of this country ; however , the plant has a name , and that &apos;s enough for the <unk> Parisian perfumer , and if the mixture he makes &quot; takes &quot; with the fashionable <unk> plant which <unk> it has a fine perfume for a certainty !
ESSENCE OF <unk> .
Esprit de violette , 1 pint . &quot;
tubereuse , 1 &quot; &quot; jasmine , 1 / 4 &quot; &quot; rose , 1 / 2 &quot; Essence de <unk> , 2 oz .
WALLFLOWER ( _ <unk> _ ) <unk> as is the odor of this flower , it is not used in perfumery , though no doubt it might be , and very successfully too , were the plant cultivated for that purpose .
To this flower we would direct particular attention , as one well adapted for experiments to obtain its odoriferous principle in this country , our climate being good for its production .
The mode for obtaining its odor has been indicated when we <unk> of heliotrope , page 60 .
And if it answers on the small scale , there is little doubt of success in the large way , and there is no fear but that the scent of the old English <unk> will meet with a demand .
An IMITATION ESSENCE OF WALLFLOWER can be compounded thus : -- Extract fleur d &apos;orange , 1 pint . &quot;
vanilla , 1 / 2 &quot; Esprit de rose , 1 &quot; Extract of orris , 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; cassie , 1 / 2 &quot; Essential oil of almonds , 5 drops .
Allow this mixture to be made up for two or three weeks prior to putting it up for sale .
WINTER GREEN ( _ <unk> <unk> _ ) .--A perfuming otto can be procured by distilling the leaves of this plant : it is principally consumed in the perfuming of soaps .
Upon the strength of the name of this odorous plant a very nice handkerchief perfume is made .
<unk> WINTER GREEN .
Esprit de rose , 1 pint .
Essence of lavender , 1 / 4 &quot; Extract of neroli , 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; vanilla , 1 / 4 &quot; &quot; vitivert , 1 / 4 &quot; &quot; cassie , 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; ambergris , 1 / 4 &quot; We have now described all the important odoriferous bodies which are used by the manufacturing perfumer , as derived from the botanic kingdom ; it may be understood that where an odoriferous material is unnoticed , it has no qualities peculiar enough to be remarked on , and that the methods adopted for preparing its essence , extract , water , or oil , are analogous to those that have been already noticed , that is , by the processes of _ maceration _ , _ absorption _ , or _ enfleurage _ for flowers , by _ tincturation _ for roots , and by _ distillation _ for seeds , modified under certain circumstances .
There are , however , three other important derivative <unk> , civet , and <unk> , being from the animal kingdom , are treated separately from plant odors , in order , it is considered , to render the whole matter less confused to manufacturers who may refer to them .
Ammonia and acetic acid , holding an indefinite position in the order we have laid down , may also come in here without much <unk> , being considered as primitive odors .
On terminating our remarks relating to the simple preparations of the odors of plants , and before we speak of perfumes of an animal origin , or of those compound _ odors _ sold as bouquets , nosegays , &amp; c . , it may probably be interesting to give a few facts and statistics , showing the consumption , in England , of the several substances previously named .
QUANTITIES OF ESSENTIAL OILS , OR OTTOS , <unk> 1 _ S. _ <unk> <unk> <unk> , <unk> FOR <unk> <unk> IN THE <unk> <unk> lbs .
Otto of bergamot , <unk> &quot; caraway , <unk> &quot; cassia , <unk> &quot; cloves , <unk> Otto of lavender , <unk> &quot; lemon , <unk> &quot; peppermint , <unk> &quot; roses , <unk> &quot; <unk> , <unk> &quot; thyme , <unk> &quot; lemon grass , } &quot; citronella , } <unk> And other ottos not otherwise described , } <unk> <unk> essential oils or ottos imported in one year , <unk> at the duty of 1 _ s . _ per pound , yield a revenue annually of <unk> _ l . _ 16 _ s . _ It would appear by the above return that our consumption of otto of cloves was exceedingly small ; whereas it is probably ten times that amount .
The fact is , several of the English wholesale druggists are very large distillers of this otto , leaving little or no room for the sale and <unk> of foreign distilled otto of cloves .
Again , otto of caraway , the English production of that article is quite equal to the foreign ; also , otto of lavender , which is drawn in this country probably to the extent of <unk> lbs .
annually .
There were also passed through the <unk> House for home consumption , in <unk> Pomatums , procured by enfleurage , maceration , &amp; c . , commonly called &quot; French Pomatums , &quot; average value of 6 _ s . _ per pound , and paying a duty of 1 _ s . _ per pound , valued by the <unk> at Â£ <unk> Perfumery not otherwise described ; value Â£ <unk> <unk> of bottles of eau de Cologne , paying a duty of 1 _ s . _ each , &#91; D &#93; <unk> Revenue from eau de Cologne manufactured out of England , say 20,000 <unk> at 8 _ d . _ = <unk> _ l . _ annually .
The total revenue derived from various sources , even upon this low scale of <unk> , from the substances with which &quot; <unk> perfumes her pocket handkerchief , &quot; cannot be estimated at less than <unk> _ l . _ per annum .
This , of course , includes the duty upon the spirits used in the home manufacture of perfumery .
SECTION IV .
PERFUMES OF ANIMAL <unk> .
In the previous articles we have only spoken of the odors of plants ; we now enter upon those materials used in perfumery of an animal origin .
The first under our notice is-- <unk> substance is found in the sea , floating near the islands of Sumatra , <unk> , and <unk> ; also on the <unk> of America , <unk> , China , Japan , and the <unk> .
The <unk> <unk> of Ireland is often found to yield large pieces of this substance .
The <unk> of the counties of <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and the <unk> of <unk> , are the principal places where it has been found .
In the &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; there is an account of a <unk> found on the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> , in the year <unk> , which weighed 52 oz . , and was <unk> on the <unk> for 20 _ l . _ , but which afterwards was sold in London for more than 100 _ l . _ ( <unk> .
<unk> .
No .
<unk> , p . <unk> ) .
We are quite within limit in stating that many <unk> concerning the origin of ambergris have been written , but the question respecting it is still at <unk> .
It is found in the <unk> of the most <unk> <unk> , these <unk> <unk> , at particular times , everything they happen to meet with .
It has been particularly found in the <unk> of the spermaceti <unk> , and most commonly in sickly fish , whence it is supposed to be the cause or effect of the disease .
Some authors , and among them Robert <unk> , consider it to be of vegetable production , and analogous to amber ; hence its name <unk> _ <unk> _ ( gray ) gray amber .
It is not , however , within the province of this work to discuss upon the various <unk> about its production , which could probably be <unk> explained if our modern <unk> were brought to bear upon the subject .
The field is open to any scientific <unk> ; all recent authors who mention it , merely <unk> the facts known more than a century ago .
A modern <unk> , speaking of ambergris , says , &quot; It smells like dried <unk> . &quot;
<unk> having smelled this latter substance , we cannot say whether the simile be correct ; but we certainly consider that its perfume is most <unk> <unk> ; nor can we <unk> that <unk> found that &quot; a vessel in which he had made a long digestion of the human <unk> had acquired a very strong and perfect smell of ambergris , <unk> that any one would have thought that a great quantity of essence of ambergris had been made in it .
The perfume ( _ odor ! _ ) was so strong that the vessel was <unk> to be moved out of the laboratory . &quot;
( <unk> .
<unk> .
Paris , <unk> . )
Nevertheless , as ambergris is extensively used as a perfume , in deference to those who admire its odor , we presume that it has to many an agreeable smell .
Like bodies of this kind undergoing a slow decomposition and possessing little volatility , it , when mixed with other very fleeting scents , gives permanence to them on the handkerchief , and for this quality the perfumer <unk> it much .
ESSENCE OF <unk> Is only kept for mixing ; when retailed it has to be <unk> up to the public nose ; it is then called after the Parisian name EXTRAIT D <unk> .
Esprit de rose triple , 1 / 2 pint .
Extract of ambergris , 1 &quot; Essence of musk , 1 / 4 &quot; Extract of vanilla , 2 ounces .
This perfume has such a lasting odor , that a handkerchief being well perfumed with it , will still retain an odor even after it has been washed .
The fact is , that both musk and ambergris contain a substance which <unk> <unk> to <unk> fabrics , and not being soluble in weak alkaline <unk> , is still found upon the material after passing through the lavatory <unk> .
Powdered ambergris is used in the manufacture of <unk> ivory or bone boxes <unk> are made to contain a paste of strong-smelling substances , to carry in the pocket or reticule ; also in the making of peau d &apos;Espagne , or Spanish skin , used for perfuming writing paper and envelopes , and which will be described hereafter .
&#91; Illustration : Civet Cat . &#93;
<unk> substance is secreted by the _ <unk> <unk> _ , or civet <unk> .
It is formed in a large double <unk> <unk> between the <unk> and the <unk> of the <unk> .
Like many other substances of Oriental origin , it was first brought to this country by the <unk> .
When the civet <unk> are kept in a state of <unk> , which at one time was common in <unk> , they are placed in strong <unk> , so constructed as to prevent the animal from turning round and <unk> the person employed in collecting the secreted substance .
This operation is said to be performed twice a week , and is done by <unk> out the civet with a small <unk> : about a drachm at a time is thus obtained .
A good deal of the civet now brought to European markets is from <unk> , capital of the province of <unk> , and from <unk> on the <unk> .
In its pure state , civet has , to nearly all persons , a most disgusting odor ; but when diluted to an infinitesimal portion , its perfume is agreeable .
It is difficult to ascertain the reason why the same substance , modified only by the quantity of matter presented to the nose , should produce an opposite effect on the olfactory nerve ; but such is the case with nearly all odorous bodies , especially with ottos , which , if smelled at , are far from nice , and in some cases , <unk> <unk> as otto of neroli , otto of thyme , otto of patchouly ; but if diluted with a thousand times its volume of oil , spirit , &amp; c . , then their fragrance is delightful .
Otto of rose to many has a sickly odor , but when eliminated in the <unk> quantities as it rises from a single <unk> , who is it that will not admit that &quot; the rose is sweet ? &quot;
The odor of civet is best <unk> , not by actual contact , but by being placed in the neighborhood of absorbent materials .
Thus , when spread upon leather , which , being covered with silk and placed in a <unk> , perfumes the paper and envelopes <unk> , and so much so , that they retain the odor after passing through the <unk> .
EXTRACT OF <unk> is prepared by rubbing in a mortar one ounce of civet with an ounce of orris-root powder , or any other similar material that will assist to break up or divide the civet ; and then placing the whole into a gallon of rectified spirits ; after macerating for a month , it is fit to strain off .
It is principally used as a &quot; fixing &quot; ingredient , in mixing essences of delicate odor .
The French perfumers use the extract of civet more than English manufacturers , who <unk> to prefer extract of musk .
From a quarter of a pint to half a pint is the utmost that ought to be mixed with a gallon of any other perfume .
CASTOR is a secretion of the _ Castor <unk> _ , or <unk> , very similar to civet .
Though we have often <unk> of its being used in perfumery , we do not personally know that such is the case .
<unk> extraordinary substance , like civet , is an animal secretion ; it is contained in <unk> <unk> about the <unk> of the male animal .
In the perfumery trade these little bags are called &quot; pods , &quot; and as imported it is called &quot; pod musk . &quot;
When the musk is separated from the skin or sack in which it is contained , it is then called &quot; grain musk . &quot;
The musk deer ( _ <unk> <unk> _ ) is an <unk> of the great mountain range which <unk> the <unk> of India , and branches out into <unk> , Thibet , and China .
And it is also found in the <unk> range , near Lake <unk> , and in some other mountain <unk> , but always on the <unk> of the line of perpetual <unk> .
It is from the male animal only that the musk is produced .
&#91; Illustration : Musk Pod , actual size . &#93;
It formerly was held in high repute as a medicine , and is still so among Eastern nations .
The musk from <unk> , Tonquin , and Thibet , is most esteemed , that from <unk> is inferior , and from Russia is of still lower quality .
The strength and the quantity produced by a single animal varies with the season of the year and the age of the animal .
A single musk pod usually contains from two to three drachms of grain musk .
Musk is imported into England from China , in <unk> of from 50 to 100 ounces each .
When adulterated with the animal &apos;s blood , which is often the case , it forms into lumps or <unk> ; it is sometimes also mixed with a dark , <unk> earth .
Those pods in which little pieces of lead are discovered , as a general rule , yield the finest quality of musk ; upon this rule , we presume that the best musk is the most worthy of adulteration .
Musk is remarkable for the <unk> and <unk> of its scent ; everything in its <unk> soon becomes affected by it , and long retains its odor , although not in actual contact with it .
It is a fashion of the present day for people to say &quot; that they do not like musk ; &quot; but , nevertheless , from great experience in one of the largest manufacturing <unk> in Europe , we are of opinion that the public taste for musk is as great as any perfumer desires .
Those substances containing it always take the preference in ready <unk> long as the vendor takes care to <unk> his customer &quot; that there is no musk in it . &quot;
&#91; Illustration : The Musk Deer . &#93;
The perfumer uses musk principally in the scenting of soap , sachet powder , and in mixing for liquid perfumery .
The just reputation of Paris &apos;s original Windsor soap is due , in the main , to its delightful odor .
The soap is , doubtless , of the finest quality , but its perfume <unk> it among the _ <unk> _ <unk> fragrance it owes to musk .
The alkaline reaction of soap is favorable to the development of the odoriferous principle of musk .
If , however , a strong solution of potass be poured on to grain musk , ammonia is developed instead of the true musk smell .
EXTRACT OF MUSK .
Grain musk , 2 oz .
Rectified spirit , 1 gallon .
After standing for one month , at a summer temperature , it is fit to draw off .
Such an extract is that which is used for mixing in other perfumes .
That extract of musk which is prepared for retail sale , is prepared thus : -- EXTRAIT DE <unk> .
Extract of musk ( as above ) , 1 pint . &quot;
ambergris , 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; rose triple , 1 / 4 &quot; Mix and filter it ; it is then fit for bottling .
This preparation is sweeter than pure extract of musk made according to our first formula , and is also more profitable to the vendor .
It will be seen hereafter that the original extract of musk is principally used for a fixing ingredient in other perfumes , to give permanence to a volatile odor ; customers <unk> , in a general way , that which is incompatible , namely , that a perfume shall be strong to smell , _ i.e. _ very volatile , and that it shall remain upon the handkerchief for a long period , _ <unk> _ , not volatile !
<unk> portions of extract of musk , mixed with esprit de rose , violet , tuberose , and others , do , in a measure , attain this object ; that is , after the violet , &amp; c . , has evaporated , the handkerchief still retains an odor , which , although not that of the original smell , yet gives satisfaction , because it is pleasant to the <unk> <unk> .
SECTION V.
<unk> the various titles of &quot; Smelling Salts , &quot; &quot; Preston Salts , &quot; &quot; Inexhaustible Salts , &quot; &quot; Eau de Luce , &quot; &quot; Sal Volatile , &quot; ammonia , mixed with other odoriferous bodies , has been very extensively consumed as material for gratifying the olfactory nerve .
The perfumer uses liq .
<unk> .
<unk> , that is , strong liquid ammonia , and the sesqui-carbonate of ammonia , for preparing the various &quot; salts &quot; that he sells .
These materials he does not attempt to make ; in fact , it is quite out of his province so to do , but he <unk> them ready for his hand through some manufacturing chemist .
The best preparation for smelling-bottles is what is termed <unk> SALTS , which is prepared thus : -- Liquid ammonia , 1 pint .
Otto of rosemary , 1 drachm . &quot;
English lavender , 1 &quot; &quot; bergamot , 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; cloves , 1 / 2 &quot; Mix the whole together with agitation in a very strong and well-stoppered bottle .
This mixture is used by filling the smelling-bottles with any porous absorbent material , such as <unk> , or , what is better , sponge cuttings , that have been well beaten , washed , and dried .
These cuttings can be procured at a <unk> price from any of the <unk> , being the <unk> or roots of the Turkey sponge , which are cut off before the <unk> <unk> it into the retail market .
After the bottles are filled with the sponge , it is thoroughly saturated with the scented ammonia , but no more is poured in than the sponge will retain , when the bottles are inverted ; as , if by any chance the ammonia runs out and is <unk> over certain colored fabrics , it causes a stain .
When such an <unk> happens , the person who sold it is <unk> <unk> .
When the sponge is saturated properly , it will retain the ammoniacal odor longer than any other material ; hence , we presume , bottles filled in this way are called &quot; inexhaustible , &quot; which name , however , they do not <unk> more than two or three months with any credit ; the warm hand soon <unk> the ammonia under any circumstances , and they require to be <unk> .
For transparent colored bottles , instead of sponge , the perfumers use what they call insoluble <unk> salts ( sulphate of potass ) .
The bottles being filled with crystals , are covered either with the liquid ammonia , scented as above , or with alcoholic ammonia .
The <unk> of the bottles are filled with a piece of white cotton ; otherwise , when inverted , from the <unk> quality of the crystals , the ammonia runs out , and causes <unk> to be made .
The crystals are <unk> in colored bottles than the sponge ; but in plain bottles the sponge appears quite as <unk> , and , as before observed , it <unk> the ammonia better than any other material .
Perfumers sell also what is called WHITE SMELLING SALTS , and PRESTON SALTS .
The White Smelling Salt is the sesqui-carbonate of ammonia in powder , with which is mixed any perfuming otto that is thought fit , <unk> otto giving , as a general rule , the most satisfaction .
PRESTON SALTS , which is the <unk> of all the ammoniacal compounds , is composed of some easily <unk> salt of ammonia and lime , such as equal parts of <unk> of ammonia , or of sesqui-carbonate of ammonia , and of <unk> lime .
When the bottles are filled with this compound , <unk> in very hard , a drop or two of some cheap otto is poured on the top prior to <unk> .
For this purpose otto of French lavender , or otto of bergamot , answers very well .
We need scarcely mention that the <unk> are dipped into melted <unk> , or <unk> over with liquid wax , that is , red or black wax dissolved in alcohol , to which a small portion of ether is added .
The only other compound of ammonia that is sold in the perfumery trade is Eau de Luce , though properly it belongs to the druggist .
When <unk> <unk> is very rarely the <unk> retains the remarkable odor of oil of amber , which renders it characteristic .
EAU DE <unk> .
Tincture of benzoin : or , } &quot; balsam of Peru , } 1 oz .
Otto of lavender , 10 drops .
Oil of amber , 5 &quot; <unk> ammonia , 2 oz .
If requisite , strain through cotton wool , but it must not be filtered , as it should have the appearance of a <unk> emulsion .
ACETIC ACID AND ITS USE IN <unk> <unk> of the odor of vinegar naturally brought it into the earliest use in the art of perfumery .
The acetic acid , evolved by distilling acetate of copper ( <unk> ) , is the true &quot; aromatic &quot; vinegar of the old alchemists .
The modern aromatic vinegar is the concentrated acetic acid aromatized with various ottos , camphor , &amp; c . , thus-- <unk> VINEGAR .
Concentrated acetic acid , 8 oz .
Otto of English lavender , 2 drachms . &quot;
&quot; rosemary , 1 drachm . &quot;
cloves , 1 &quot; &quot; camphor , 1 oz .
First dissolve the bruised camphor in the acetic acid , then add the perfumes ; after remaining together for a few days , with occasional agitation , it is to be strained , and is then ready for use .
Several forms for the preparation of this substance have been published , almost all of which , however , appear to <unk> and <unk> a process that is all simplicity .
The most popular article of this kind is-- <unk> &apos;S VINEGAR .
Dried leaves of rosemary , rue , wormwood , sage , mint , and lavender flowers , each , 1 / 2 oz .
<unk> nutmeg , cloves , angelica root , and camphor , each , 1 / 4 oz .
Alcohol ( rectified ) , 4 oz .
Concentrated acetic acid , 16 oz .
Macerate the materials for a day in the spirit ; then add the acid , and digest for a week longer , at a temperature of about 14 Â° C. or 15 Â° C. Finally , press out the new aromatized acid , and filter it .
As this mixture must not go into the ordinary metallic tincture press , for the obvious reason of the chemical action that would ensue , it is best to drain as much of the liquor away as we can , by means of a common funnel , and then to <unk> the residue from the interstices of the herbs , by <unk> them up in a linen cloth , and subjecting them to pressure by means of an ordinary <unk> , or similar <unk> .
VINAIGRE A LA ROSE .
Concentrated acetic acid , 1 oz .
Otto of roses , 1 / 2 drachm .
Well shaken together .
It is obvious that vinegars <unk> perfumed may be made in a similar manner to the above , by using other ottos in place of the otto of roses .
All these concentrated vinegars are used in the same way as perfumed ammonia , that is , by pouring three or four drachms into an ornamental &quot; smelling &quot; bottle , previously filled with crystals of sulphate of potash , which forms the &quot; <unk> de vinaigre &quot; of the shops ; or upon sponge into little silver boxes , called <unk> , from their French origin .
The use of these vinegars had their origin in the <unk> of keeping those who carried them from the effects of <unk> disease , doubtless <unk> out of the story of the &quot; four <unk> &apos; vinegar , &quot; which is thus rendered in <unk> &apos;s <unk> : &quot; It is said that during the <unk> at Marseilles , four persons , by the use of this <unk> , attended , <unk> , multitudes of those that were affected ; that under the color of these services , they <unk> both the sick and the <unk> ; and that being afterwards <unk> , one of them <unk> himself from the <unk> by <unk> the composition of the prophylactic ( a very likely story ! !
) , which was as follows : -- VINAIGRE DES <unk> <unk> , OR <unk> <unk> &apos; VINEGAR .
Take fresh <unk> of common wormwood , Roman wormwood , rosemary , sage , mint , and rue , of each , 3 / 4 oz .
Lavender flowers , 1 oz .
<unk> , calamus aromaticus , cinnamon , cloves , and nutmeg , each , 1 drachm .
Camphor , 1 / 2 oz .
Alcohol or brandy , 1 oz .
Strong vinegar , 4 pints .
Digest all the materials , except the camphor and spirit , in a closely covered vessel for a fortnight , at a summer heat ; then express and filter the vinaigre produced , and add the camphor previously dissolved in the brandy or spirit . &quot;
A very similar and quite as effective a preparation may be made by dissolving the odorous principle of the plants indicated in a mixture of alcohol and acetic acid .
Such preparations , however , are more within the province of the druggist than perfumer .
There are , however , several preparations of vinegar which are sold to some extent for mixing with the water for lavatory purposes and the bath , their <unk> <unk> to place them in <unk> with Eau de Cologne , but with little <unk> .
Among them may be <unk> <unk> OR <unk> VINEGAR .
<unk> , 1 pint .
Otto of cloves , 1 drachm . &quot;
lavender , 1 &quot; &quot; marjoram , 1 / 2 drachm .
Gum benzoin , 1 oz .
Macerate these together for a few hours , then <unk> Brown vinegar , 2 pints .
and strain or filter , if requisite , to be bright .
TOILET VINEGAR ( _ Ã  la <unk> _ ) .
Extract of cassie , 1 / 2 pint . &quot;
orris , 1 / 4 &quot; Esprit de rose , triple , 1 / 4 &quot; White wine vinegar , 2 pints .
TOILET VINEGAR ( _ Ã  la Rose _ ) .
Dried rose-leaves , 4 oz .
Esprit de rose , triple , 1 / 2 pint .
White wine vinegar , 2 pints .
Macerate in a close vessel for a fortnight , then filter and bottle for sale .
VINAIGRE DE COLOGNE .
To eau de Cologne , 1 pint , Add , strong acetic acid , 1 / 2 oz .
Filter if necessary .
Without unnecessarily repeating similar formulÃ¦ , it will be obvious to the reader that vinegar of any flower may be prepared in a similar way to those above noticed ; thus , for vinaigre Ã  la jasmine , or for vinaigre Ã  la fleur d &apos;orange , we have only to substitute the esprit de jasmine , or the esprit de fleur d &apos;orange , in place of the Eau de Cologne , to produce orange-flower or jasmine vinegars ; however , these latter articles are not in demand , and our only reason for explaining how such preparations may be made , is in order to suggest the methods of procedure to any one desirous of making them leading articles in their trade .
We perhaps may observe , _ en <unk> _ , that where economy in the production of any of the toilet vinegars is a matter of consideration , they have only to be diluted with rose-water down to the profitable strength required .
Any of the perfumed vinegars that are required to produce <unk> , when mixed with water , must contain some gum-resin , like the <unk> vinegar , as above .
<unk> myrrh , benzoin , storax , or tolu , answer equally well .
SECTION VI .
BOUQUETS AND NOSEGAYS .
In the previous articles we have endeavored to explain the mode of preparing the primitive <unk> original odors of plants .
It will have been observed , that while the majority can be obtained under the form of otto or essential oil , there are others which hitherto have not been isolated , but exist only in solution in alcohol , or in a fatty body .
Of the latter are included all that are most prized , with the exception of otto of <unk> <unk> among the odoriferous <unk> .
<unk> , we have no essential oils or ottos of Jasmine , Vanilla , Acacia , Tuberose , Cassie , Syringa , <unk> , and others .
What we know of these odors is derived from esprits , obtained from oils or fats , in which the several flowers have been repeatedly infused , and afterwards infusing such fats or oils in alcohol .
<unk> , these odors are the most generally pleasing , while those made from the essential oils ( _ i.e. _ otto ) , dissolved in spirit , are of a <unk> character .
The simple odors , when isolated , are called ESSENTIAL OILS or OTTOS ; when dissolved or existing in solution in alcohol , by the English they are termed ESSENCES , and by the French <unk> or <unk> ; a few <unk> prove this rule .
Essential oil of orange-peel , and of lemon-peel , are frequently termed in the trade &quot; Essence &quot; of orange and &quot; Essence &quot; of lemons , instead of essential oil or otto of lemons , &amp; c . The sooner the correct nomenclature is used in perfumery , as well as in the <unk> arts , the better , and the <unk> <unk> will be made in the <unk> .
It appears to the writer , that if the nomenclature of these substances were revised , it would be serviceable ; and he would suggest that , as a significant , <unk> , and <unk> term , Otto be used as a <unk> to denote that such and such a body is the odoriferous principle of the plant .
We should then have otto of lavender instead of essential oil of lavender , &amp; c . &amp; c . In this work it will be seen that the writer has generally used the word OTTO in place of &quot; essential oil , &quot; in accordance with his <unk> .
Where there exists a solution of an essential oil in a fat oil , the necessity of some such significant distinction is rendered obvious , for commercially such articles are still called &quot; oils &quot; <unk> of jasmine , oil of roses , &amp; c . It cannot be expected that the public will use the <unk> &quot; fat &quot; oil and &quot; essential &quot; oil , to distinguish these <unk> of composition .
There are several good <unk> why the odoriferous principle of plants should not be denominated oils .
In the first place , it is a bad principle to give any class of substances the same <unk> as those <unk> to another .
<unk> , there are enough <unk> qualities in their composition , their physical character , and chemical reaction , to <unk> the application of a significant name to that large class of substances known as the aroma of plants !
When the chemical nomenclature was last revised , the organic bodies were little <unk> with .
We know that we owe this universal &quot; oil &quot; to the old alchemist , much in the same way as &quot; spirit &quot; has been used , but a little consideration quickly indicates the <unk> of its continued use .
We can no longer call otto of rosemary , or otto of nutmegs , essential oil of rosemary or nutmegs , with any more <unk> than we can term sulphuric acid &quot; oil &quot; of <unk> .
All the chemical works speak of the odoriferous bodies as &quot; essential &quot; or &quot; volatile &quot; oils , and of the greasy bodies as &quot; fat &quot; or &quot; unctuous &quot; oils .
Oils , properly so called , unite with <unk> bases and form soap ; whereas the essential or volatile oils , _ i.e. _ what we would please to call the ottos , do no such thing .
On the contrary , they unite with acids in the majority of instances .
The word oil must hereafter be confined to those bodies to which its <unk> meaning <unk> , unctuous , inodorous ( when pure ) , greasy <unk> can no longer be applied to those odoriferous materials which possess qualities <unk> opposite to oil .
We have <unk> with &quot; spirit , &quot; and fixed its meaning in a chemical sense ; we have no longer &quot; spirit &quot; of salt , or &quot; spirit &quot; of <unk> .
Let us no longer have almond oil &quot; essential , &quot; almond oil &quot; unctuous , &quot; and the like .
It remains only for us to complete the branch of perfumery which relates to odors for the handkerchief , by giving the formulÃ¦ for preparing the most favorite &quot; bouquets &quot; and &quot; nosegays . &quot;
These , as before stated , are but mixtures of the simple ottos in spirit , which , properly blended , produce an agreeable and characteristic odor , <unk> effect upon the smelling nerve similar to that which music or the mixture of <unk> sounds produces upon the nerve of hearing , that of pleasure .

The reputation of this perfume has given rise to numerous <unk> of the original article , more particularly on the continent .
In many of the shops in Germany and in France will be seen bottles labelled in close imitation of those sent out by Bayley and Co . , <unk> Street , London , who are , in truth , the original makers .

&quot; _ Petale _ , 1 / 2 &quot; &quot; rosemary , 2 &quot; &quot; orange-peel , } &quot; lemon , } of each , 4 &quot; &quot; bergamot , } Although Eau de Cologne was originally introduced to the public as a sort of &quot; <unk> , &quot; a regular &quot; <unk> of life , &quot; it now takes its place , not as a <unk> product , but among perfumery .
Of its remedial qualities we can say nothing , such matter being <unk> to the purpose of this book .
<unk> , however , as a perfume , with the public taste it <unk> very high ; and although it is exceedingly volatile and <unk> , yet it has that excellent quality which is called &quot; refreshing . &quot;
Whether this be due to the rosemary or to the spirit , we cannot say , but think something may be <unk> to both .
One important thing relating to Eau de Cologne must not , however , pass unnoticed , and that is , the quality of the spirit used in its manufacture .
The utter impossibility of making brandy with English spirit in any way to resemble the real Cognac , is well known .
It is equally impossible to make Eau de Cologne with English spirit , to resemble the original article .
To speak of the &quot; purity &quot; of French spirit , or of the &quot; <unk> &quot; of English spirit , is equally <unk> .
The fact is , that spirit derived from <unk> , and spirit obtained from corn , have each so distinct and characteristic an aroma , that the one cannot be mistaken for the other .
The odor of grape spirit is said to be due to the oeanthic ether which it contains .
The English spirit , on the other hand , owes its odor to fusel oil .
So powerful is the oeanthic ether in the French spirit , that notwithstanding the addition to it of such intensely odoriferous substances as the ottos of neroli , rosemary , and others , it still gives a characteristic perfume to the products made containing it , and hence the difficulty of preparing Eau de Cologne with any spirit <unk> of this substance .
Although very fine Eau de Cologne is often made by merely mixing the ingredients as indicated in the recipe as above , yet it is better , first , to mix all the citrine ottos with spirit , and then to distil the mixture , afterwards adding to the distillate the rosemary and <unk> , such process being the one adopted by the most popular house at Cologne .
A great many forms for the manufacture of Eau de Cologne have been published , the authors of some of the recipes evidently having no knowledge , in a practical sense , of what they were putting by theory on paper ; other <unk> , to show their <unk> , have <unk> out all the aromatics of Lindley &apos;s <unk> , and would <unk> us to use <unk> , <unk> , anise , <unk> , marjoram , caraway , fennel , <unk> , <unk> , cinnamon , nutmeg , <unk> , angelica , cloves , lavender , camphor , balm , peppermint , <unk> , lemon thyme , &amp; c . &amp; c . &amp; c . All these , however , are but <unk> !
Where it is a mere matter of profit , and the formula that we have given is too expensive to produce the article required , it is better to dilute the said Cologne with a weak spirit , or with rose-water , rather than otherwise alter its form ; because , although weak , the true aroma of the original article is retained .
The recipe of the second quality of Eau de Cologne is given , to show that a very <unk> article can be produced with English spirit .

<unk> of the materials employed being different to the original English recipe , it must be remembered that all the French perfumes are made of brandy , _ i.e. _ grape spirit ; whereas the English perfumes are made with corn spirit , which alone <unk> their odor .
Though good for some mixtures , yet for others the grape spirit is very objectionable , on account of the predominance of its own aroma .
We have spoken of the difference in the odor between the English and French spirit ; the marked distinction of British and Parisian perfumes made according to the same recipes is entirely due to the different spirits employed .
<unk> to the strong &quot; bouquet , &quot; as the French say , of their spirit in comparison with <unk> , the continental perfumers claim a superiority in the quality of their perfumes .
Now , although we <unk> admit that _ some _ odors are better when prepared with grape spirit than with that from corn spirit , yet there are others which are undoubtedly the best when prepared with spirit derived from the latter source .
Musk , ambergris , civet , violet , tubereuse , and jasmine , if we require to retain their true aroma when in solution in alcohol , must be made with the British spirit .
All the citrine odors , <unk> , <unk> waters , Eau de Cologne , Eau de Portugal , Eau d <unk> , and lavender , can alone be brought to perfection by using the French spirit in their manufacture .
If extract of jasmine , or extract of violet , &amp; c . , be made with the French or brandy spirit , the true characteristic odor of the flower is lost to the olfactory <unk> completely does the oeanthic ether of the grape spirit hide the flowery aroma of the otto of violet in solution with it .
This <unk> the <unk> that English extract of violet and its compounds , &quot; spring flowers , &quot; &amp; c . , is at all times in demand on the Continent , although the very flowers with which we make it are grown there .
On the contrary , if an English perfumer attempts to make Eau de Portugal , &amp; c . , to bear any comparison as a fine odor to that made by <unk> , of Paris , without using grape spirit , his attempts will prove a <unk> .
<unk> , he makes Eau de Portugal even with English corn spirit , but <unk> of the <unk> they alone can <unk> its <unk> instantly the same difference as the <unk> finds out between &quot; <unk> British &quot; and foreign brandy .
Perhaps it may not be out of place here to observe that what is sold in this country as British brandy is in truth grape spirit , that is , foreign brandy very largely diluted with English spirit !
By this <unk> , a real <unk> to the foreign brandy flavor is maintained ; the difference in duty upon English and foreign spirit enables the makers of the &quot; <unk> &quot; article to <unk> those who <unk> the unsophisticated Cognac .
Some chemists , not being very deep in the &quot; <unk> of trade , &quot; have thought that some flavoring , or that oeanthic ether , was used to impart to British spirit the Cognac aroma .
An article is even in the market called &quot; Essence of Cognac , &quot; but which is nothing more than very badly made butyric ether .
On the Continent a great deal of spirit is procured by the fermentation of the <unk> from <unk> ; this , of course , finds its way into the market , and is often mixed with the grape spirit ; so , also , in England we have spirit from potatoes , which is mixed in the corn spirit .
These <unk> , if we may so term it , modify the relative odors of the primitive alcohols .

RONDELETIA .
The perfume bearing the above name is undoubtedly one of the most gratifying to the smelling nerve that has ever been made .
Its <unk> , Messrs. <unk> and <unk> , have probably taken the _ name _ of this odor from the _ Rondeletia _ , the _ <unk> _ of the Chinese ; or from the R. odorata of the West Indies , which has a sweet odor .
We have before observed that there is a similarity of effect upon the olfactory nerve produced by certain odors , although derived from totally different sources : that , for instance , otto of almonds may be mixed with extract of violet in such proportion that , although the odor is increased , yet the character peculiar to the violet is not destroyed .
Again : there are certain odors which , on being mixed in due proportion , produce a new aroma , perfectly distinct and peculiar to itself .
This effect is <unk> by comparison with the influence of certain colors when mixed , upon the nerve of <unk> : such , for instance , as when yellow and blue are mixed , the result we call green ; or when blue and red are <unk> , the compound color is known as <unk> or violet .
Now when the odor of lavender and odor of cloves are mixed , they produce a new fragrance , _ i.e. _ Rondeletia !
It is such combinations that constitute in reality &quot; a new perfume , &quot; which , though often <unk> , is very rarely attained .
Jasmine and patchouly produce a <unk> aroma , and many others in like manner ; proportion and relative strength , when so mixed , must of course be <unk> , and the substances used accordingly .
If the same quantity of any given otto be dissolved in a like proportion of spirit , and the solution be mixed in equal proportions , the strongest odor is instantly indicated by covering or <unk> the presence of the other .
In this way we discover that patchouly , lavender , neroli , and verbena are the most <unk> of the vegetable odors , and that violet , tubereuse , and jasmine are the most delicate .
Many persons will at first consider that we are <unk> too much , when we express a desire to have the same deference paid to the olfactory nerve , as to the other <unk> that influence our physical <unk> and <unk> .
By <unk> the olfactory nerve , it is capable of <unk> matter in the atmosphere of the most <unk> nature : not only that which is pleasant , but also such as are <unk> .
If an unpleasant odor is a warning to seek a purer atmosphere , <unk> it is worth while to cultivate that power which enables us to act up to that warning for the general benefit of health .
To return , however , to Rondeletia : it will be seen by the <unk> formulÃ¦ , that , besides the main ingredients to which it owes its peculiar <unk> is , cloves and <unk> contains musk , vanilla , &amp; c . These substances are used in these as in nearly all other bouquets for the <unk> purpose of fixing the more volatile odors to the handkerchief .

The just reputation of this perfume places it in the first rank of the very best mixtures that have ever been made by any manufacturing perfumer .
Its odor is <unk> flowery , but peculiar to itself .
Being <unk> any other aroma it cannot well be imitated , chiefly because there is nothing that we are acquainted with that at all resembles the odor of the esprit de rose , as derived from macerating rose pomade in spirit , to which , and to the extract of violet , nicely <unk> , so that neither odor predominates , the peculiar character of &quot; Spring Flowers &quot; is due ; the little ambergris that is present gives permanence to the odor upon the handkerchief , although from the very nature of the ingredients it may be said to be a fleeting odor .
&quot; Spring Flowers &quot; is an Englishman &apos;s invention , but there is scarcely a perfumer in Europe that does not attempt an imitation .
<unk> NOSEGAY .
Nearly all the <unk> tribe , although beautiful to the eye , are inodorous .
The variety called the <unk> <unk> <unk> , however , yields an exquisite perfume , but it is not used by the manufacturer for the purpose of extracting its odor .
He , however , <unk> its poetical name , and makes an excellent imitation thus : -- Extract of tubereuse , } from pomade each , 1 pint . &quot;

We have now completed the branch of the Art of Perfumery which relates to handkerchief perfumes , or wet perfumery .
Although we have rather too much <unk> upon the <unk> of this work in giving the composition of so many bouquets , yet there are many left unnoticed which are popular .
Those that are given are noted more particularly for the peculiar character of their odor , and are <unk> from more than a thousand recipes that have been practically tried .
Those readers who require to know anything about the simple extracts of flowers are referred to them under their respective alphabetical titles .
SECTION VII .
The previous articles have <unk> treated of <unk> Perfumes ; the present matter relates , to Dry Perfumes , <unk> powders , tablets , pastilles , fumigation by the aid of heat of volatile odorous resins , &amp; c . &amp; c . The perfumes used by the ancients were , undoubtedly , nothing more than the odoriferous gums which naturally exude from various trees and <unk> indigenous to the Eastern <unk> : that they were very extensively used and much valued , we have only to read the <unk> for <unk> : -- &quot; <unk> is this that <unk> <unk> perfumed with myrrh and frankincense , with all the powders of the <unk> ? &quot;
( <unk> of <unk> , 3 : 6 . )
<unk> from the use of perfume in Eastern countries is considered as a <unk> of <unk> : -- &quot; The Lord will take away the tablets , and it shall come to pass that instead of a sweet smell there shall be a <unk> . &quot;
( <unk> .
35 : 22 ; <unk> 3 : 20 , 24 . )
The word tablets in this passage means perfume boxes , <unk> <unk> , made of metal , wood , and ivory .
Some of these boxes may have been made in the shape of <unk> , which would explain the word _ palaces _ , in <unk> 14 : 8 : -- &quot; All thy <unk> smell of myrrh , and <unk> , and cassia , out of the ivory palaces , whereby they have made thee glad . &quot;
From what is said in <unk> .
2 : <unk> , it would appear that perfumes were considered among the most valuable gifts which man could <unk> ; -- &quot; And when they ( the <unk> men ) had opened their <unk> , they presented unto him ( <unk> ) gifts ; gold , and frankincense , and myrrh . &quot;
As far as we are able to learn , all the perfumes used by the Egyptians and <unk> during the early period of the world were _ dry _ perfumes , consisting of <unk> ( _ <unk> <unk> _ ) , myrrh , olibanum , and other gum-resins , nearly all of which are still in use by the manufacturers of odors .
Among the curiosities shown at Alnwick Castle is a vase that was taken from an Egyptian catacomb .
It is full of a mixture of gum-resin , &amp; c . , which evolve a pleasant odor to the present day , although probably 3000 years old .
We have no doubt that the original use of this vase and its contents were for perfuming apartments , in the same way that pot pourri is now used .
SACHET POWDERS .
The French and English perfumers <unk> a great variety of these substances , which being put into silk bags , or ornamental envelopes , find a ready sale , being both good to smell and economical as a means of imparting an agreeable odor to linen and clothes as they lie in drawers .
The following formula shows their composition .
Every material is either to be ground in a mill , or powdered in a mortar , and afterwards sifted .

santal , } <unk> , ground , 1 oz .
The name of this sachet has been <unk> down to us as being derived from a Roman of the <unk> family of Frangipani .
<unk> Frangipani was an alchemist , evidently of some repute , as we have another article called <unk> , or <unk> , _ <unk> _ , an aromatic spirituous liquor , used as a <unk> , of which he is said to be the inventor , composed of wine , in which is steeped <unk> , fennel , anise , and musk .

We need scarcely observe that the salt is only used to increase the bulk and weight of the product , in order to sell it cheap .
OLLA <unk> .
This is a similar preparation to pot pourri .
No regular form can be given for it , as it is generally made , or &quot; <unk> up , &quot; with the refuse and spent materials derived from other processes in the manufacture of perfumery ; such as the spent vanilla after the manufacture of tincture or extract of vanilla , or of the grain musk from the extract of musk , orris from the tincture , tonquin beans , after tincturation , &amp; c . &amp; c . , mixed up with rose-leaves , lavender , or any odoriferous herbs .

VITIVERT SACHET .
The <unk> roots of the _ Anthoxanthum <unk> _ being ground , constitute the sachet , bearing the name as above , derived from the <unk> name , _ <unk> <unk> _ , and by the Parisian _ <unk> _ .
Its odor resembles myrrh .
Vitivert is more often sold tied up in bunches , as imported from India , than ground , and is used for the <unk> of moth , rather than as a perfume .
VIOLET SACHET .
Black-currant leaves ( _ casse _ ) , 1 lb .
Rose heels or leaves , 1 lb .
Orris-root powder , 2 lbs .
Otto of almonds , 1 / 4 drachm .
Grain musk , 1 &quot; Gum benzoin , in powder , 1 / 2 lb .
Well mix the ingredients by sifting ; keep them together for a week in a glass or porcelain jar before offering for sale .
There are many other sachets manufactured besides those already given , but for actual trade purposes there is no advantage in keeping a greater variety than those named .
There are , however , many other substances used in a similar way ; the most popular is the <unk> D <unk> .
<unk> d &apos;Espagne , or Spanish skin , is nothing more than highly perfumed leather .
Good <unk> pieces of wash leather are to be steeped in a mixture of ottos , in which are dissolved some odoriferous gum-resins , thus : <unk> of neroli , otto of rose , santal , of each half an ounce ; otto of lavender , verbena , bergamot , of each a quarter of an ounce ; otto of cloves and cinnamon , of each two drachms ; with any others thought fit .
In this mixture dissolve about two ounces of gum benzoin ; now place the skin to steep in it for a day or so , then <unk> it over a line to dry .
A paste is now to be made by rubbing in a mortar one drachm of civet with one drachm of grain musk , and enough solution of gum acacia or gum tragacantha to give it a spreading consistence ; a little of any of the ottos that may be left from the steep stirred in with the civet , &amp; c . , greatly assists in making the whole of an equal body ; the skin being cut up into pieces of about four inches <unk> are then to be spread over , plaster fashion , with the <unk> <unk> ; two pieces being put together , having the civet plaster <unk> them , are then to be placed between sheets of paper , weighed or pressed , and left to dry thus for a week ; finally , each double skin , now called peau d &apos;Espagne , is to be <unk> in some pretty silk or <unk> , and finished off to the taste of the <unk> .
<unk> or leather thus prepared <unk> a pleasant odor for years , and hence they are frequently called &quot; the inexhaustible sachet . &quot;
Being flat , they are much used for perfuming <unk> .
The lasting odor of Russia leather is familiar to all and pleasing to many ; its perfume is due to the aromatic <unk> with which it is <unk> , and to the empyreumatic oil of the bark of the birch tree , with which it is <unk> .
The odor of Russia leather is , however , not _ recherchÃ© _ enough to be considered as a perfume ; but , nevertheless , leather can be impregnated by <unk> in the various ottos with any sweet scent , and which it retains to a remarkable degree , especially with otto of santal or lemon-grass ( _ Verbena _ ) .
In this manner the odor of the peau d &apos;Espagne can be greatly varied , and gives great satisfaction , on account of the permanence of its perfume .
PERFUMED <unk> .
If a piece of peau d &apos;Espagne be placed in contact with paper , the latter absorbs sufficient odor to be considered as &quot; perfumed ; &quot; it is obvious that paper for writing upon must not be <unk> with any of the odorous tinctures or ottos , on account of such matters <unk> with the <unk> of the ink and action of the <unk> ; therefore , by the process of <unk> , as it were , alone can writing paper be perfumed to advantage .
Besides the sachets mentioned there are many other substances applied as dry perfumes , such as scented <unk> , used for <unk> into all sorts of articles adapted for use in a lady &apos;s <unk> .
<unk> , <unk> cases , and the like are lined with it .
Cotton , so perfumed , is simply steeped in some strong essence of musk , &amp; c . PERFUMED <unk> .
We have seen that leather can be impregnated with odoriferous substances , in the manufacture of peau d &apos;Espagne ; just so is <unk> treated prior to being made up into <unk> .
In <unk> them for sale , taste alone <unk> their <unk> ; some are ornamented with beads , others with <unk> .
<unk> AND <unk> .
<unk> and Printaniers are little ivory boxes , of various <unk> , perforated in order to allow the escape of the odors contained therein .
The paste used for filling these &quot; ivory palaces whereby we are made glad , &quot; is composed of equal parts of grain musk , ambergris , seeds of the <unk> , otto of roses , and orris powder , with enough gum acacia , or gum tragacantha , to work the whole together into a paste .
These things are now principally used for perfuming the pocket or reticule , much in the same way that ornamental silver and gold <unk> are used .
PASTILS .
There is no doubt whatever that the origin of the use of pastils , or pastilles , as they are more often called , from the French , has been derived from the use of incense at the altars of the temples during the religious services : -- &quot; According to the custom of the priest &apos;s office , his lot ( <unk> &apos; ) was to burn incense when he <unk> into the temple of the Lord . &quot;
( Luke 1 : 9 . )
&quot; And thou shalt make an altar to burn incense <unk> And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning when he dresseth the lamps , and at even when he <unk> the lamps he shall burn incense upon it . &quot;
( Exodus 30 . )
An analogous practice is in use to the present day in the Roman <unk> churches , but , instead of being consumed upon an altar , the incense is burned in a censer , as doubtless many of our readers have seen .
&quot; As soon as the <unk> was given by the chief priest the incense was <unk> , the holy place was filled with perfume , and the congregation without <unk> in prayers . &quot;
( _ <unk> <unk> service of the Hebrews . _ ) THE <unk> .
&quot; On the walls of every temple in Egypt , from <unk> to <unk> , the censer is <unk> smoking before the <unk> <unk> of the place ; on the walls of the tombs <unk> in bright colors the preparation of spices and perfumes . &quot;
In the British Museum there is a vase ( No .
<unk> ) the body of which is intended to contain a lamp , the sides being perforated to admit the heat from the flame to act upon the projecting tubes ; which are intended to contain ottos of flowers placed in the small <unk> at the end of the tubes ; the heat volatilizes the ottos , and quickly perfumes an apartment .
This vase or censer is from an Egyptian catacomb .
&#91; Illustration : The Censer . &#93;
The Censer , as used in the &quot; holy places , &quot; is made either of brass , German silver , or the precious metals ; its form somewhat resembles a saucer and an inverted cup , which latter is perforated , to allow the escape of the perfume .
In the outer saucer is placed an <unk> one of copper , which can be taken out and filled with ignited charcoal .
When in use , the ignited carbon is placed in the censer , and is then covered with the incense ; the heat rapidly volatilizes it in <unk> fumes .
The effect is assisted by the <unk> swinging the censer , attached to three long chains , in the air .
The manner of swinging the censer varies slightly in the churches in Rome , in France , and in England , some holding it above the head .
At LA <unk> the method is always to give the censer a full <unk> at the greatest length of the chains with the right hand , and to <unk> it up short with the left hand .
Several samples of &quot; incense prepared for altar service , &quot; as sent out by Mr. <unk> , of <unk> , appear to be nothing more than gum olibanum , of indifferent quality , and not at all like the composition as especially commanded by <unk> , the form for which is given in full in Exodus .
The pastils of the <unk> are really but a very slight modification of the incense of the ancients .
For many years they were called <unk> of Cyprus .
In the old books on pharmacy a certain mixture of the then known gum-resins was called <unk> , which being thrown upon hot ashes produced a vapor which was considered to be <unk> in many diseases .
It is under the same impression that pastils are now used , or at least to cover the _ mal odeur _ of the <unk> .
There is not much variety in the formula of the pastils that are now in use ; we have first the <unk> , OR YELLOW PASTILS .

After well beating in a mortar , the pastils are formed in shape with a pastil mould , and gradually dried .
The Chinese <unk> are of a similar composition , but contain no Tolu .

nitre in half a pint of distilled or ordinary rose water ; with this solution thoroughly wet the charcoal , and then allow it to dry in a warm place .
When the thus <unk> charcoal is quite dry , pour over it the mixed ottos , and stir in the flowers of benzoin .
When well mixed by sifting ( the sieve is a better tool for mixing powders than the pestle and mortar ) , it is finally beaten up in a mortar , with enough mucilage to <unk> the whole together , and the less that is used the better .
A great variety of formulÃ¦ have been published for the manufacture of pastils ; <unk> of them contain some woods or bark , or aromatic seeds .
Now , when such substances are burned , the chemist <unk> that if the ligneous <unk> contained in them undergoes <unk> slow <unk> are produced which have far from a pleasant odor ; in fact , the smell of burning wood predominates over the volatilized aromatic ingredients ; it is for this reason alone that charcoal is used in lieu of other substances .
The use of charcoal in a pastil is merely for burning , producing , during its combustion , the heat required to quickly volatilize the perfuming material with which it is surrounded .
The product of the combustion of charcoal is inodorous , and therefore does not in any way interfere with the fragrance of the pastil .
Such is , however , not the case with any ingredients that may be used that are not in themselves perfectly volatile by the aid of a small <unk> of heat .
If combustion takes place , which is always the case with all the aromatic woods that are introduced into pastils , we have , besides the volatilized otto which the wood contains , all the compounds naturally produced by the slow burning of ligneous matter , <unk> the true odor of the other ingredients volatilized .
There are , it is true , certain kinds of fumigation adopted occasionally where these products are the materials sought .
By such fumigation , as when brown paper is allowed to <unk> ( undergo slow combustion ) in a room for the purpose of covering bad smells .
By the <unk> combustion of tobacco , that is , combustion with flame , there is no odor developed , but by its slow combustion , according to the method adopted by those who indulge in &quot; the weed , &quot; the familiar aroma , &quot; the <unk> , &quot; is generated , and did not exist ready formed in the tobacco .
Now a <unk> pastil should not <unk> any odor of its own , but simply volatilize that fragrant matter , whatever it be , used in its manufacture .
We think that the fourth formula given above carries out that object .
It does not follow that the formulÃ¦ that are here given produce at all times the odor that is most approved ; it is evident that in pastils , as with other perfumes , a great deal depends upon taste .
Many persons very much object to the aroma of benzoin , while they greatly admire the fumes of cascarilla .
THE PERFUME <unk> .
<unk> after the discovery of the peculiar property of spongy platinum remaining incandescent in the vapor of alcohol , the <unk> Mr.
I. <unk> , of <unk> , made a very <unk> application of it for the purpose of perfuming apartments .
An ordinary spirit lamp is filled with Eau de Cologne , and &quot; <unk> &quot; with a wick in the usual manner .
<unk> the centre of the wick , and standing about the <unk> of an inch above it , a small ball of spongy platinum is placed , maintained in its position by being fixed to a thin glass rod , which is inserted into the wick .
&#91; Illustration : Perfume Lamp . &#93;
Thus arranged , the lamp is to be <unk> and allowed to burn until the platinum becomes red hot ; the flame may then be blown out , nevertheless the platinum remains incandescent for an indefinite period .
The <unk> of a red-hot ball to a material of the physical quality of Eau de Cologne , diffused over a surface of cotton wick , as a matter of course causes its rapid evaporation , and as a consequence the diffusion of odor .
Instead of the lamp being charged with Eau de Cologne , we may use Eau de Portugal , vervaine , or any other spirituous essence .
Several perfumers make a particular mixture for this purpose , which is called EAU A BRULER .
Eau de Cologne , 1 pint .
Tincture of benzoin , 2 oz . &quot;
vanilla , 1 oz .
Otto of thyme , } &quot; mint , } of each , 1 / 2 drachm . &quot;
nutmeg , } Another form , called EAU <unk> BRULER .
Rectified spirit , 1 pint .
Benzoic acid , 1 / 2 oz .
Otto of thyme , } of each , 1 drachm . &quot;
caraway , } &quot; bergamot , 2 oz .
Persons who are in the <unk> of using the perfume lamps will , however frequently observe that , whatever difference there may be in the composition of the fluid introduced into the lamp , there is a degree of similarity in the odor of the result when the platinum is in action .
This arises from the fact , that so long as there is the vapor of alcohol , mixed with <unk> , passing over red-hot platinum , certain definite products always result , namely , acetic acid , aldehyde , and <unk> , which are formed more or less and impart a peculiar and rather agreeable fragrance to the vapor , but which <unk> any other odor that is present .
<unk> <unk> .
There are two modes of preparing this article : -- 1 .
Take sheets of light <unk> paper , and <unk> them into a solution of <unk> , alum , one ounce ; water , one pint .
After they are thoroughly moistened , let them be well dried ; upon one side of this paper spread a mixture of equal parts of gum benzoin , olibanum , and either balm of Tolu or Peruvian balsam , or the benzoin may be used alone .
To spread the gum , &amp; c . , it is necessary that they be melted in an <unk> vessel and poured <unk> over the paper , finally <unk> the surface with a hot spatula .
When required for use , slips of this paper are held over a candle or lamp , in order to evaporate the odorous matter , but not to <unk> it .
The alum in the paper prevents it a to certain extent from burning .
2 .
<unk> of good light paper are to be steeped in a solution of <unk> , in the proportions of two ounces of the salt to one pint of water , to be afterwards thoroughly dried .
Any of the odoriferous gums , as myrrh , olibanum , benzoin , &amp; c . , are to be dissolved to saturation in rectified spirit , and with a brush spread upon one side of the paper , which , being <unk> up , rapidly dries .
Slips of this paper are to be <unk> up as <unk> , to be ignited , and then to be blown out .
The nitre in the paper causes a <unk> of slow combustion , <unk> during that time the agreeable perfume of the odoriferous gums .
If two of these sheets of paper be pressed together before the surface is dry , they will <unk> and become as one .
When cut into slips , they form what are called <unk> Lighters , or Perfumed <unk> .
SECTION VIII .
PERFUMED SOAP .
The word soap , or <unk> , from the Greek _ <unk> _ , first <unk> in the works of Pliny and Galen .
Pliny <unk> us that soap was first discovered by the <unk> , that it was composed of tallow and ashes , and that the German soap was reckoned the best .
According to <unk> , the French <unk> , a <unk> was included in the <unk> of <unk> .
At <unk> ( <unk> by an <unk> of <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , a <unk> &apos;s <unk> with soap in it was discovered during some <unk> made there not many years ago .
( _ <unk> &apos;s <unk> from Italy . _ ) From these statements it is evident that the manufacture of soap is of very ancient origin ; indeed , Jeremiah <unk> <unk> <unk> &quot; For though thou wash thee with <unk> , and take thee much soap , yet thine <unk> is marked before me . &quot;
( Jer .
2 : 22 . )
Mr. Wilson says that the earliest <unk> of the soap trade in England is to be found in a <unk> in the British Museum , printed in <unk> , <unk> &quot; A short <unk> of the Soap <unk> . &quot;
It speaks more particularly about the duty , which was then <unk> for the first time , and concerning certain <unk> which were granted to persons , chiefly <unk> <unk> , for some <unk> new invention of white soap , &quot; which in truth was not so . &quot;
<unk> is said here to prove that at that time soap-making was no inconsiderable art .
It would be out of place here to enter into the details of soap-making , because perfumers do not manufacture that substance , but are merely &quot; <unk> , &quot; to use a trade term .
The <unk> purchases his <unk> from the drysalters already <unk> , and these are merely modified under his hands to the various purposes he requires ; so with the perfumer , he purchases the various soaps in their raw state from the <unk> , these he mixes by remelting , scents and colors according to the article to be produced .
The <unk> soaps are divided into hard and soft soaps : the hard soaps contain soda as the base ; those which are soft are prepared with potash .
These are again <unk> into <unk> , according to the fatty matter employed in their manufacture , also according to the proportion of alkali .
The most important of these to the perfumer is what is termed curd soap , as it forms the basis of all the <unk> soaps .
<unk> SOAP is a nearly neutral soap , of pure soda and fine tallow .
OIL SOAP , as made in England , is an <unk> combination of olive oil and soda , hard , close grain , and contains but little water in combination .
<unk> SOAP , as imported from <unk> , is a similar combination , but is colored by <unk> of iron .
The solution of the salt being added to the soap after it is manufactured , from the presence of alkali , decomposition of the salt takes place , and protoxide of iron is diffused through the soap of its well-known black color , giving the familiar marbled appearance to it .
When the soap is cut up into bars , and exposed to the air , the protoxide passes by absorption of oxygen into peroxide ; hence , a <unk> of a bar of Castile soap shows the outer edge <unk> , while the interior is <unk> .
Some Castile soap is not artificially colored , but a similar appearance is produced by the use of a <unk> or soda containing sulphuret of the alkaline base , and at other times from the presence of an iron salt .
<unk> SOAP is a <unk> soap , of soda containing a great excess of alkali , and much water combination .
YELLOW SOAP is a soda soap , of tallow , resin , of lard , &amp; c . &amp; c . <unk> SOAP is a soda soap of palm oil , retaining the peculiar odor and color of the oil unchanged .
The odoriferous principle of palm oil resembling that from orris-root , can be dissolved out of it by tincturation with alcohol ; like ottos generally , it remains <unk> in the presence of an alkali , hence , soap made of palm oil retains the odor of the oil .
The public require a soap that will not <unk> and change shape after they purchase it .
It must make a <unk> <unk> during the act of washing .
It must not leave the skin <unk> after using it .
It must be either quite inodorous or have a pleasant aroma .
<unk> of the above soaps possess all these qualities in union , and , therefore , to produce such an article is the object of the perfumer in his remelting process .
Prior to the removal of the excise duty upon soap , in <unk> , it was a commercial impossibility for a perfumer to _ manufacture _ soap , because the law did not allow less than one ton of soap to be made at a time .
This law , which , with certain modifications had been in force since the reign of Charles I , confined the actual manufacture of that article to the hands of a few <unk> .
Such law , however , was but of little importance to the perfumer , as a <unk> plant and apparatus is not very compatible with a laboratory of flowers ; yet , in some <unk> instances , these excise <unk> <unk> with him ; such , for instance , as that in making soft soap of lard and potash , known , when perfumed , as _ CrÃªme d &apos;Amande _ ; or <unk> , as a Saponaceous Cream , which has , in consequence of that law , been entirely thrown into the hands of our continental neighbors .
<unk> SOFT SOAP is a combination of oils , principally olive oil of the <unk> kind , with potash .
NAPLES SOFT SOAP is a fish oil ( mixed with <unk> oil ) and potash , colored brown for the London <unk> , retaining , when pure , its unsophisticated &quot; <unk> &quot; odor .
The above soaps constitute the real body or base of all the fancy scented soaps as made by the perfumers , which are mixed and remelted according to the following formula : -- The remelting process is exceedingly simple .
The bar soap is first cut up into thin slabs , by <unk> them against a wire fixed upon the working bench .
This <unk> wire ( <unk> wire is the kind ) is made <unk> upon the bench , by being attached to two screws .
These screws regulate the height of the wire from the bench , and hence the <unk> of the slabs from the bars .
The soap is cut up into thin slabs , because it would be next to impossible to melt a bar whole , on account of soap being one of the <unk> <unk> of heat .
The melting pan is an iron vessel , of various <unk> , capable of holding from 28 lbs .
to 3 cwt . , heated by a steam <unk> , or by a water-bath .
The soap is put into the pan by degrees , or what is in the <unk> called &quot; rounds , &quot; that is , the thin slabs are placed <unk> all round the side of the pan ; a few ounces of water are at the same time introduced , the steam of which assists the melting .
The pan being covered up , in about half an hour the soap will have &quot; run down . &quot;
Another round is then introduced , and so continued every half hour until the whole &quot; melting &quot; is finished .
The more water a soap contains , the <unk> is it melted ; hence a round of marine soap , or of new yellow soap , will run down in half the time that it requires for old soap .
When different soaps are being remelted to form one kind when finished , the various sorts are to be inserted into the pan in alternate rounds , but each round must consist only of one kind , to insure uniformity of condition .
As the soap melts , in order to mix it , and to break up lumps , &amp; c . , it is from time to time &quot; _ crutched _ . &quot;
The &quot; crutch &quot; is an instrument or tool for stirring up the soap ; its name is indicative of its form , a long <unk> with a short <unk> inverted &apos; <unk> &apos; , <unk> to fit the <unk> of the pan .
When the soaps are all melted , it is then colored , if so required , and then the perfume is added , the whole being thoroughly incorporated with the crutch .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> and Slab Gauge . &#93;
The soap is then turned into the &quot; frame . &quot;
The frame is a box made in sections , in order that it can be taken to pieces , so that the soap can be cut up when cold ; the sections or &quot; lifts &quot; are frequently made of the <unk> of the intended bar of soap .
&#91; Illustration : Barring Gauge . &#93;
Two or three days after the soap has been in the frame , it is cool enough to cut into slabs of the size of the lifts or sections of the frame ; these slabs are set up <unk> to cool for a day or two more ; it is then <unk> by means of a wire .
The lifts of the frame regulate the <unk> of the bars ; the <unk> <unk> their <unk> .
The density of the soap being pretty well known , the <unk> are made so that the <unk> can cut up the bars either into <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> ; that is , either into squares of four , six , or eight to the pound weight .
<unk> , various mechanical <unk> have been introduced for <unk> , which in very large <unk> , such as those at Marseilles in France , are great <unk> of labor ; but in England the &quot; wire &quot; is still used .
&#91; Illustration : Squaring Gauge . &#93;
&#91; Illustration : Soap <unk> . &#93;
For making tablet <unk> the soap is first cut into squares , and is then put into a mould , and finally under a <unk> modification of an ordinary <unk> or <unk> press .
Balls are cut by hand , with the aid of a little tool called a &quot; <unk> , &quot; made of brass or ivory , being , in fact , a <unk> knife .
Balls are also made in the press with a mould of appropriate form .
The <unk> form and fruit shape are also obtained by the press and appropriate moulds .
The <unk> soaps , after leaving the mould , are dipped into melted wax , and are then colored according to artificial <unk> &apos; rules .
&#91; Illustration : Soap Press . &#93;
&#91; Illustration : Moulds . &#93;
The &quot; <unk> &quot; colored soaps are produced by adding the various colors , such as smalt and vermilion , previously mixed with water , to the soap in a melted state ; these colors are but slightly crutched in , hence the <unk> appearance or party color of the soap ; this kind is also termed &quot; marbled &quot; soap .
ALMOND SOAP .
This soap , by some persons &quot; supposed &quot; to be made of &quot; sweet almond oil , &quot; and by others to be a <unk> combination of sweet and bitter almonds , is in reality <unk> thus : -- Finest curd soap , 1 cwt . &quot;
oil soap , 14 lbs . &quot;
marine , 14 lbs .
Otto of almonds , 1-1 / 2 lb . &quot;
cloves , 1 / 4 lb . &quot;
caraway , 1 / 2 lb .
By the time that half the curd soap is melted , the marine soap is to be added ; when this is well crutched , then add the oil soap , and finish with the remaining curd .
When the whole is well melted , and just before turning it into the frame , crutch in the mixed perfume .
Some of the soap &quot; houses &quot; endeavored to use <unk> or artificial essence of almonds ( see ALMOND ) for perfuming soap , it being far cheaper than the true otto of almonds ; but the application has proved so <unk> in practice , that it has been <unk> by Messrs. <unk> , <unk> ( of Paris ) , Gosnell , and others who used it .

The above forms are indicative of the method adopted for perfuming soaps while hot or melted .
All the very highly scented soaps are , however , perfumed cold , in order to avoid the loss of scent , 20 per cent .
of perfume being evaporated by the hot process .
The variously named soaps , from the sublime &quot; <unk> &quot; to the <unk> &quot; <unk> &apos;s <unk> , &quot; we cannot of course be expected to notice ; the reader may , however , rest <unk> that he has lost nothing by their <unk> .
The receipts given produce only the finest quality of the article named .
Where cheap soaps are required , not much <unk> is necessary to <unk> that by omitting the expensive perfumes , or <unk> the quantity , the object desired is attained .
Still lower qualities of scented soap are made by using greater proportions of yellow soap , and employing a very common curd , omitting the oil soap <unk> .
SCENTING SOAPS <unk> .
In the previous remarks , the methods explained of scenting soap <unk> the necessity of melting it .
The high temperature of the soap under these circumstances involves the obvious loss of a great deal of perfume by evaporation .
With very highly scented soaps , and with perfume of an expensive character , the loss of ottos is too great to be borne in a commercial sense ; hence the <unk> of the plan of SCENTING SOAPS COLD .
This method is exceedingly convenient and economical for scenting small <unk> , <unk> merely mechanical labor , the <unk> required being simply an ordinary <unk> &apos;s plane , and a good marble mortar , and lignum <unk> pestle .
The <unk> of the plane must be <unk> at each end , so that when placed over the mortar it remains firm and not easily moved by the parallel pressure of the soap against its projecting blade .
To <unk> operations , we take first 7 lbs . , 14 lbs . , or 21 lbs .
of the bars of the soap that it is intended to perfume .
The plane is now laid <unk> down across the top of the mortar .
<unk> being thus arranged , the whole of the soap is to be <unk> across the plane until it is all reduced into fine shavings .
Like the French &quot; <unk> , &quot; who does not saw the wood , but woods the saw , so it will be perceived that in this process we do not plane the soap , but that we soap the plane , the shavings of which <unk> <unk> into the mortar as quickly as produced .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> the Plane . &#93;
Soap , as generally received from the maker , is the proper condition for thus working ; but if it has been in stock any time it becomes too hard , and must have from one to three ounces of distilled water sprinkled in the shaving for every pound of soap employed , and must lay for at least twenty-four hours to be absorbed before the perfume is added .
When it is determined what size the cakes of soap are to be , what they are to sell for , and what it is intended they should cost , then the maker can measure out his perfume .
In a general way , soaps scented in this way retail from 4 _ s . _ to 10 _ s . _ per pound , bearing about 100 per cent .
profit , which is not too much <unk> their limited sale .
The soap being in a proper physical condition with regard to moisture , &amp; c . , is now to have the perfume well stirred into it .
The pestle is then set to work for the process of <unk> .
After a <unk> of hours of &quot; warm exercise , &quot; the soap is generally expected to be free from <unk> , and to be of one uniform consistency .
For perfuming soap in large portions by the cold process , instead of using the pestle and mortar as an <unk> , it is more convenient and economical to employ a mill similar in <unk> to a cake <unk> , or a <unk> <unk> ; any mechanical apparatus that answers for mixing paste and <unk> lumps will serve pretty well for <unk> soap together .
Before going into the mill , the soap is to be reduced to shavings , and have the scent and color stirred in ; after leaving it , the flakes or <unk> of soap are to be finally bound together by the pestle and mortar into one solid mass ; it is then weighed out in quantities for the tablets required , and <unk> by the hand into <unk> <unk> ; each piece being left in this condition , separately laid in <unk> on a <unk> of white paper , dries sufficiently in a day or so to be fit for the press , which is the same as that previously mentioned .
It is usual , before placing the cakes of soap in the press , to dust them over with a little <unk> , or else to very slightly oil the mould ; either of these <unk> prevents the soap from adhering to the <unk> or <unk> work of the <unk> condition essential for turning out a clean <unk> tablet .
The body of all the fine soaps mentioned below should consist of the finest and <unk> curd soap , or of a soap previously melted and colored to the required shade , thus : -- <unk> SOAP is curd soap stained with vermilion , ground in water , thoroughly incorporated when the soap is melted , and not very hot .
GREEN SOAP is a mixture of palm oil soap and curd soap , to which is added powdered smalt ground with water .
<unk> SOAP , curd soap colored with smalt .
BROWN SOAP , curd soap with caramel , _ i.e. _ burnt sugar .
The <unk> of color varies , of course , with the quantity of coloring .
Some kinds of soap become colored or tinted to a sufficient extent by the mere addition of the ottos used for scenting , such as &quot; spermaceti soap , &quot; &quot; lemon soap , &quot; &amp; c . , which become of a beautiful pale lemon color by the mere mixing of the perfume with the curd soap .

The preparation sold under this title is a potash soft soap of lard .
It has a beautiful pearly appearance , and has met with extensive demand as a shaving soap .
Being also used in the manufacture of EMULSINES , it is an article of no inconsiderable consumption by the perfumer .
It is made thus : -- <unk> lard , 7 lbs .

The <unk> is then finished , but is not pearly ; it will , however , assume that appearance by long trituration in a mortar , gradually adding the alcohol , in which has been dissolved the perfume .

<unk> <unk> SOAP .
This soap is made from the tar of the wood of the _ <unk> <unk> _ , by dissolving it in a fixed vegetable oil , such as almond or olive oil , or in fine tallow , and forming a soap by means of a weak soda lye , after the <unk> manner .
This yields a <unk> firm and clear soap , which may be readily used by application to parts affected with <unk> at night , mixed with a little water , and carefully washed off the following morning .
This soap has lately been much used for <unk> <unk> , particularly on the Continent , and with varying degrees of success .
It is thought that the <unk> <unk> in its composition is a rather less impure <unk> than that known in Paris under the name _ huile de <unk> _ .
On account of its ready <unk> with water , it possesses great advantage over the common tar ointment .
<unk> SOAPS .
<unk> years ago I began making a series of medicated soaps , such as <unk> SOAP , <unk> SOAP , <unk> SOAP , <unk> SOAP , <unk> SOAP , <unk> OIL SOAP , and many others .
These soaps are prepared by adding the medicant to curd soap , and then making in a tablet form for use .
For sulphur soap , the curd soap may be melted , and flowers of sulphur added while the soap is in a soft condition .
For <unk> soap and <unk> soap , the low <unk> of the metals employed may also be mixed in the curd soap in a melted state .
<unk> , <unk> , <unk> soap , and others containing very volatile substances , are best prepared cold by shaving up the curd soap in a mortar , and mixing the medicant with it by long beating .
In certain <unk> diseases the author has reason to believe that they will prove of <unk> service as <unk> to the general treatment .
It is obvious that the absorbent vessels of the skin are very active during the <unk> process ; such soap must not , therefore , be used except by the special advice of a medical man .
Probably these soaps will be found useful for <unk> application .
The <unk> of the use of Castile soap ( containing oxide of iron ) renders it likely that when <unk> has passed away , such soaps will find a place in the <unk> .
The discovery of the solubility , under certain conditions , of the active <unk> , quinine , <unk> , &amp; c . , in oil , by Mr. W. Bastick , greatly <unk> the supposition of analogous compounds in soap .
SECTION IX .
EMULSINES .
From soaps proper we now pass to those compounds used as substitutes for soap , which are <unk> together under one general title as above , for the reason that all cosmetiques herein <unk> have the property of forming emulsions with water .
Chemically considered , they are an exceedingly interesting class of compounds , and are well worthy of study .
Being prone to decomposition , as might be expected from their composition , they should be made only in small portions , or , at least , only in quantities to meet a ready sale .
While in stock they should be kept as cool as possible , and free from a damp atmosphere .

Rub the syrup with the soft soap until the mixture is <unk> , then rub in the oil by degrees ; the perfume having been previously mixed with the oil .
&#91; Illustration : <unk> in <unk> <unk> . &#93;
In the manufacture of amandine ( and olivine ) the difficulty is to get in the quantity of oil indicated , without which it does not assume that transparent jelly appearance which good amandine should have .
To attain this end , the oil is put into &quot; a runner , &quot; that is , a tin or glass vessel , at the bottom of which is a small <unk> and <unk> , or tap .
The oil being put into this vessel is allowed to run slowly into the mortar in which the amandine is being made , just as fast as the maker finds that he can <unk> it with the paste of soap and syrup ; and so long as this takes place , the result will always have a jelly texture to the hand .
If , however , the oil be put into the mortar quicker than the <unk> can blend it with the paste , then the paste becomes &quot; oiled , &quot; and may be considered as &quot; done for , &quot; unless , indeed , the whole process be gone through again , <unk> off with fresh syrup and soap , using up the greasy mass as if it were pure oil .
This liability to &quot; go off , &quot; increases as the amandine <unk> the finish ; hence <unk> caution and plenty of &quot; <unk> grease &quot; must be used during the addition of the last two pounds of oil .
If the oil be not perfectly fresh , or if the temperature of the atmosphere be above the average of summer heat , it will be almost impossible to get the whole of the oil given in the formula into combination ; when the mass becomes bright and of a <unk> <unk> , it will be well to <unk> the further addition of oil to it .
This and similar compounds should be <unk> as quickly as made , and the <unk> of the pots <unk> either with <unk> of <unk> or paper , to exclude air .
When the amandine is filled into the jars , the top or face of it is marked or ornamented with a tool made to the size of half the diameter of the interior of the jar , in a similar way to a saw ; a piece of lead or <unk> , being <unk> with an <unk> file , or piece of an &quot; old saw , &quot; will do very well ; place the <unk> on the amandine , and turn the jar gently round .

Place the ground almonds and one pint of the rose-water into a <unk> ; with a slow and <unk> heat , <unk> the almonds until their granular texture assumes a pasty form , constantly stirring the mixture during the whole time , otherwise the almonds quickly burn to the bottom of the pan , and impart to the whole an empyreumatic odor .
The large quantity of otto of almonds which is volatilized during the process , renders it essential that the <unk> should avoid the vapor as much as possible .
When the almonds are nearly <unk> , the remaining water is to be added ; finally the paste is put into a mortar , and well rubbed with the pestle ; then the perfume and spirit are added .
Before <unk> this paste , as well as honey paste , it should be passed through a medium fine sieve , to insure uniformity of texture , especially as almonds do not <unk> <unk> .
Other <unk> , such as _ PÃ¢te de <unk> _ , _ PÃ¢te de <unk> _ , _ PÃ¢te de <unk> _ , are prepared in so similar a manner to the above that it is unnecessary to say more about them here , than that they must not be <unk> with preparations bearing a similar name made by confectioners .

On account of the high price of the French oils , these preparations are expensive , but they are undoubtedly the most exquisite of cosmetiques .
SECTION X.
MILK , OR EMULSIONS .
In the perfumery trade , few articles meet with a more ready sale than that class of cosmetiques denominated milks .
It has long been known that nearly all the seeds of plants which are called nuts , when decorticated and freed from their pellicle , on being reduced to a <unk> mass , and rubbed with about four times their weight of water , produce fluid which has every analogy to <unk> &apos;s milk .
The milky appearance of these emulsions is due to the minute mechanical <unk> of the oil derived from the nuts being diffused through the water .
All these emulsions possess great chemical interest on account of their rapid decomposition , and the products <unk> from their fermentation , especially that made with sweet almonds and <unk> ( _ <unk> vera _ ) .
In the manufacture of various milks for sale , careful manipulation is of the utmost importance , otherwise these emulsions &quot; will not keep ; &quot; hence more loss than profit .
&quot; <unk> takes place in the elements of vegetable <unk> ( existing in seeds ) from _ the very moment _ that sweet almonds are converted into <unk> . &quot; <unk> .

White wax , spermaceti , oil soap , each , 1 / 2 oz .
_ Manipulation _ <unk> up the soap , and place it in a vessel that can be heated by steam or water-bath ; add to it two or three ounces of rose-water .
When the soap is perfectly melted , add the wax and spermaceti , without dividing them more than is necessary to obtain the correct weight ; this <unk> their melting slowly , and allows time for their <unk> saponification by the fluid soap ; occasional stirring is necessary .
While this is going on , <unk> the almonds , carefully <unk> every <unk> that is in the least way damaged .
Now proceed to beat up the almonds in a <unk> clean mortar , allowing the rose-water to trickle into the mass by degrees ; the runner , as used for the oil in the manufacture of olivine , is very convenient for this purpose .
When the emulsion of almonds is thus finished , it is to be strained , _ without pressure _ , through clean _ washed _ muslin ( _ new _ muslin often contains starch , flour , gum , or <unk> ) .
The <unk> saponaceous mixture is now to be placed in the mortar , and the <unk> emulsion in the runner ; the <unk> compound and the emulsion is then carefully blended together .
As the last of the emulsion runs into the mortar , the spirit , in which the otto of roses has been dissolved , is to take its place , and to be _ gradually _ <unk> into the other ingredients .
A too <unk> addition of the spirit frequently <unk> the milk and causes it to be curdled ; as it is , the temperature of the mixture rises , and every means must be taken to keep it down ; the constant agitation and cold mortar effecting that object pretty well .
Finally , the now formed milk of roses is to be strained .
The almond residue may be washed with a few ounces of fresh rose-water , in order to prevent any loss in bulk to the whole given quantity .
The <unk> milk should be placed into a bottle having a tap in it about a quarter of an inch from the bottom .
After standing perfectly quiet for twenty-four hours it is fit to bottle .
All the above <unk> being taken , the milk of roses will keep any time without precipitate or creamy <unk> .
These directions apply to all the other forms of milk now given .

SECTION XI .
COLD CREAM .
<unk> , the celebrated <unk> of <unk> , in Asia , but who distinguished himself at <unk> , <unk> , and Rome , about <unk> years ago , was the inventor of that peculiar unguent , a mixture of grease and water , which is now distinguished as cold cream in perfumery , and as _ <unk> <unk> _ in Pharmacy .
The modern formula for cold cream is , however , quite a different thing to that given in the works of Galen in point of odor and quality , although <unk> the <unk> and water .
In perfumery there are several kinds of cold cream , distinguished by their odor , such as that of camphor , almond , violet , roses , &amp; c . Cold cream , as made by English perfumers , bears a high reputation , not only at home , but <unk> Europe ; the quantity exported , and which can only be reckoned by jars in hundreds of <unk> , and the repeated <unk> that may be seen in the shops on the Continent , in Germany , France , and Italy , of &quot; Cold CrÃªme <unk> , &quot; is good proof of the estimation in which it is held .
ROSE COLD CREAM .
Almond oil , 1 lb .
Rose-water , 1 lb .
White wax , } spermaceti , } each , 1 oz .
Otto of roses , 1 / 2 drachm .
_ Manipulation _ <unk> a well-glazed thick porcelain vessel , which should be deep in preference to <unk> , and capable of holding twice the quantity of cream that is to be made , place the wax and sperm ; now put the jar into a boiling bath of water ; when these materials are melted , add the oil , and again subject the whole to heat until the flocks of wax and sperm are liquefied ; now remove the jar and contents , and set it under a runner containing the rose-water : the runner may be a tin can , with a small tap at the bottom , the same as used for the manufacture of milk of roses .
A <unk> must be provided , made of <unk> , flat , and perforated with <unk> the size of a <unk> , resembling in form a large <unk> .
As soon as the rose-water is set running , the cream must be kept agitated until the whole of the water has passed into it ; now and then the flow of water must be <unk> , and the cream which sets at the sides of the jar scraped down , and incorporated with that which remains fluid .
When the whole of the water has been incorporated , the cream will be cool enough to pour into the jars for sale ; at that time the otto of rose is to be added .
The reason for the perfume being put in at the last moment is <unk> heat and subsequent agitation would cause unnecessary loss by evaporation .
Cold cream made in this way sets quite <unk> in the jars into which it is poured , and retains &quot; a face &quot; resembling pure wax , although one-half is water retained in the interstices of the cream .
When the pots are well <unk> , it will keep good for one or two years .
If desired for exportation to the East or West Indies , it should always be sent out in stoppered bottles .
COLD CREAM OF ALMONDS Is prepared precisely as the above ; but in place of otto of roses otto of almonds is used .

Almond oil , 1 lb .
Green oil , 1 oz .
<unk> of cucumber , 1 lb .
Wax and sperm , each , 1 oz .
Otto of neroli , 1 / 4 drachm .
The cucumber juice is readily obtained by subjecting the fruit to pressure in the ordinary tincture press .
It must be <unk> to a temperature high enough to <unk> the small portion of <unk> which it contains , and then strained through fine linen , as the heat is detrimental to the odor on account of the great volatility of the otto of cucumber .
The following method may be adopted with advantage : <unk> the fruit very fine with a <unk> , and place them in the oil ; after remaining together for twenty-four hours , repeat the operation , using fresh fruit in the strained oil ; no warmth is necessary , or at most , not more than a summer heat ; then proceed to make the cold cream in the usual manner , using the almond oil thus <unk> , the rose-water , and other ingredients in the regular way , perfuming , if necessary , with a little neroli .
Another and <unk> preparation of cucumber is found among the Parisians , which is lard simply scented with the juice from the fruit , thus : --The lard is liquefied by heat in a vessel subject to a water-bath ; the cucumber juice is then stirred well into it ; the vessel containing the ingredients is now placed in a quiet situation to cool .
The lard will rise to the surface , and when cold must be removed from the fluid juice ; the same manipulation being repeated as often as required , according to the strength of odor of the fruit desired in the grease .
<unk> &apos; POMADE OF CUCUMBER .
<unk> lard , 6 lbs .
Spermaceti , 2 lbs .
Essence of cucumbers , 1 lb .
Melt the stearine with the lard , then keep it constantly in motion while it cools , now beat the grease in a mortar , gradually adding the essence of cucumbers ; continue to beat the whole until the spirit is evaporated , and the pomade is beautifully white .
_ <unk> _ and other similar fruit will scent grease treated in the same way .

COMMON LIP SALVE Is made simply of equal parts of lard and suet , colored with alkanet root , and perfumed with an ounce of bergamot to every pound of salve .
SECTION XII .
POMADES AND OILS .
The name of pomatum is derived from _ <unk> _ , an apple , because it was originally made by macerating <unk> apples in grease .
If an apple be stuck all over with spice , such as cloves , then exposed to the air for a few days , and afterwards macerated in purified melted lard , or any other fatty matter , the grease will become perfumed .
<unk> the operation with the same grease several times , produces real &quot; pomatum . &quot;
According to a recipe published more than a century ago the form given is : -- &quot; <unk> &apos;s grease , an orange <unk> , <unk> , a glass of rose-water , and half a glass of white wine , boiled and strained , and at last sprinkled with oil of sweet almonds . &quot;
The author , Dr. Quincy , <unk> , that &quot; the apple is of no significance at all in the recipe , &quot; and , like many authors of the present day , <unk> that the reader is as well acquainted with the subject as the writer , and therefore considers that the <unk> or bulk of the materials in his recipe are , likewise , of no significance .
According to ancient writers , unguent , pomatum , ointment , are synonymous titles for medicated and perfumed greases .
Among <unk> <unk> , the significant word is mostly rendered &quot; ointment ; &quot; thus we have in <unk> .
<unk> : 9 , &quot; <unk> and perfume <unk> the heart ; &quot; in <unk> .
9 : 8 , &quot; Let thy head <unk> no ointment . &quot;
Perfumers , acting upon their own or Dr. Quincy &apos;s advice , pay no regard to the apples in the preparation of pomatum , but make it by perfuming lard or suet , or a mixture of wax , spermaceti , and oil , or some of them or all blended , to produce a particular result , according to the name that it bears .
The most important thing to consider in the manufacture of pomatum , &amp; c . , is to start off with a _ perfectly inodorous _ grease , whatever that grease may be .
<unk> lard is obtained thus : --Take , say 28 lbs .
of _ perfectly fresh _ lard , place it in a well-glazed vessel , that can be submitted to the heat of a boiling salt-water bath , or by steam under a slight pressure ; when the lard is melted , add to it one ounce of powdered alum and two ounces of <unk> salt ; maintain the heat for some time , in fact till a <unk> rises , consisting in a great measure of <unk> proteine compounds , membrane , &amp; c . , which must be skimmed off ; when the liquid grease appears of a uniform nature it is allowed to <unk> cold .
The lard is now to be washed .
This is done in small portions at a time , and is a work of much labor , which , however , is <unk> <unk> by the result .
About a pound of the grease is now placed on a slate slab a little on the <unk> , a supply of good water being set to trickle over it ; the surface of the grease is then constantly <unk> by an operative working a <unk> over it , precisely as a <unk> <unk> <unk> in oil .
In this way the water <unk> any traces of alum or salt , also the last traces of nitrogenous matter .
Finally , the grease , when the whole is washed in this way , is remelted , the heat being maintained enough to drive off any adhering water .
When cold it is finished .
Although <unk> grease in this way is <unk> , and takes a good deal of time , yet unless done so , it is totally <unk> for perfuming with flowers , because a bad grease will cost more in perfume to cover its _ mal odeur _ than the expense of thus <unk> it .
Moreover , if lard be used that &quot; smells of the <unk> , &quot; it is next to impossible to impart to it any delicate odor ; and if strongly perfumed by the addition of ottos , the <unk> grease will not keep , but quickly becomes rancid .
Under any circumstances , therefore , grease that is not _ perfectly inodorous _ is a very expensive material to use in the manufacture of pomades .
In the South and <unk> countries , where the fine pomades are made by <unk> , or by <unk> &#91; G &#93; ( see pp .
37 , 38 ) , the purification of grease for the purpose of these manufactures is of sufficient importance to become a separate trade .
The purification of <unk> and mutton suet is in a great measure the same as that for lard : the greater solidity of <unk> requires a mechanical arrangement for washing them of a more powerful nature than can be applied by hand labor .
Mr. <unk> , who is undoubtedly the best <unk> in London , employs a stone roller rotating upon a <unk> slab ; motion is given to the roller by an <unk> which passes through the centre of the slab , or rather stone bed , upon which the suet is placed ; being higher in the centre than at the sides , the stream of water flows away after it has once passed over the suet ; in other <unk> the treatment is the same as for lard .
These greases used by perfumers have a general title of &quot; body , &quot; <unk> to the French nomenclature of _ corps _ ; thus we have pomades of hard corps ( suet ) , pomades of soft corps ( lard ) .
For making _ extraits _ , such as extrait de violette , jasmin , the pomades of hard corps are to be preferred ; but when scented pomade is to be used in fabrication of unguents for the hair , pomades of soft corps are the most useful .
The method of perfuming grease by the direct process with flowers having already been described under the respective names of the flowers that impart the odor thereto , it remains now only to describe those compounds that are made from them , together with such <unk> matter connected with this branch of perfumery as has not been previously mentioned .
ACACIA POMADE , commonly called <unk> POMATUM , is made with a purified <unk> , by maceration with the little round yellow buds of the _ Acacia Farnesiana _ .
Black currant leaves , and which the French term _ cassie _ , have an odor very much resembling cassie ( acacia ) , and are used extensively for <unk> the true acacia pomades and oils .
The near similarity of name , their analogous odor ( although the plants have no <unk> <unk> ) , together with the word _ cassia _ , a familiar perfume in England , has produced generally confused <unk> in this country as to the true origin of the odor now under discussion .
Cassie , casse , cassia , it will be understood now , are three distinct substances ; and in order to render the matter more <unk> in future , the materials will always be denominated ACACIA , if prepared from the _ Acacia Farnesiana _ ; <unk> , when from _ black currant _ ; and <unk> , if derived from the bark of the _ Cinnamomum Cassia _ .
BENZOIN POMADE AND OIL .
Benzoic acid is perfectly soluble in hot grease .
<unk> an ounce of benzoic acid being dissolved in half a pint of hot olive or almond oil , deposits on cooling beautiful <unk> crystals , similar to the crystals that <unk> from vanilla beans ; a portion of the acid , however , remains dissolved in the oil at the ordinary temperature , and imparts to it the peculiar aroma of benzoin ; upon this idea is based the principle of perfuming grease with gum benzoin by the direct process , that is , by macerating powdered gum benzoin in melted suet or lard for a few hours , at a temperature of about 80 Â° C. to 90 Â° C. Nearly all the gum-resins give up their odoriferous principle to fatty bodies , when treated in the same way ; this fact becoming generally known , will probably give rise to the preparation of some new remedial <unk> , such as _ Unguentum <unk> _ , _ Unguentum <unk> _ , and the like .
TONQUIN POMADE , and TONQUIN OIL , are prepared by macerating the ground Tonquin beans in either melted fat or warm oil , from twelve to <unk> hours , in the proportion of Tonquin beans , 1 / 2 lb .
Fat or oil , 4 lbs .
<unk> through fine muslin ; when cold , the grease will have a fine odor of the beans .
VANILLA OIL AND POMADE .
Vanilla pods , 1 / 4 lb .
Fat or oil , 4 lbs .
Macerate at a temperature of 25 Â° C. for three or four days ; finally strain .
These pomatums and oils , together with the French pomades and huiles already described , constitute the <unk> of the preparations of all the best hair greases sold by perfumers .
<unk> scented pomatums and oils are prepared by perfuming lard , suet , wax , oil , &amp; c . , with various ottos ; the results , however , in many instances more expensive than the foregoing , are actually inferior in their odor or <unk> grease , however slightly perfumed by maceration or enfleurage with flowers , is far more agreeable to the olfactory nerve than when scented by ottos .
The <unk> greases have obtained great <unk> , mainly because their perfume is lasting and flowery .
POMADE CALLED <unk> &apos;S <unk> .
The most popular and &quot; original &quot; bears &apos; grease is made thus : -- Huile de rose , } &quot; fleur d &apos;orange , } &quot; acacia , } of each , 1 / 2 lb . &quot;
tubereuse and jasmin , } Almond oil , 10 lbs .
Lard , 12 lbs .
Acacia pomade , 2 lbs .
Otto of bergamot , 4 oz . &quot;
cloves , 2 oz .
Melt the solid greases and oils together by a water-bath , then add the ottos .
<unk> &apos; grease thus prepared is just hard enough to &quot; set &quot; in the pots at a summer heat .
In very warm <unk> , or if required for exportation to the East or West Indies , it is necessary to use in part French pomatums instead of oils , or more lard and less almond oil .

COMMON VIOLET POMATUM .
Purified lard , 1 lb .

rose pomatum , 4 oz .
Manipulate as for <unk> pomatum .
In all the cheap preparations for the hair , the manufacturing perfumers used the washed French pomatums and the washed French oils for making their greases .
Washed pomatums and washed oils are those greases that originally have been the best pomatums and huiles prepared by enfleurage and by maceration with the flowers ; which pomades and huiles have been subject to digestion in alcohol for the manufacture of essences for the handkerchief .
After the spirit has been on the pomatums , &amp; c . , it is poured off ; the residue is then called _ washed _ pomatum , and still retain an odor strong enough for the manufacture of most hair greases .
For pomatums of other odors it is only necessary to substitute rose , jasmine , tubereuse , and others , in place of the acacia pomatum in the above formulÃ¦ .
POMADE <unk> , MILLEFLEURS .
Rose , jasmine , fleur d &apos;orange , violet , tubereuse , &amp; c . , are all made in winter , with two-thirds best French pomatum , one-third best French oils ; in summer , equal parts .

SECTION XIII .
HAIR DYES AND DEPILATORY .
By way of personal adornment , few <unk> are of more ancient origin than that of painting the face , <unk> the hair , and blackening the eyebrows and eyelashes .
It is a practice universal among the women of the higher and <unk> <unk> in Egypt , and very common among those of the lower <unk> , to blacken the edge of the eyelids , both above and below the eye , with a black powder , which they term _ kohhl _ .
The kohhl is applied with a small probe of wood , ivory , or silver , <unk> towards the end , but <unk> .
This is moistened sometimes with rose-water , then dipped in the powder , and drawn along the <unk> of the eyelids .
It is thought to give a very soft expression to the eye , the size of which , in appearance , it <unk> ; to which circumstances probably Jeremiah refers when he writes , &quot; Though thou <unk> thy face ( or thine eyes ) with painting , in <unk> shalt thou make <unk> fair . &quot;

A singular custom is <unk> both among <unk> and <unk> <unk> of <unk> the face between the eyes with <unk> of <unk> spots or other small devices , and which , being stained , become permanent .
The <unk> is also <unk> in a similar manner , and a narrow blue line extends from the point of it , and is continued down the <unk> .
The eyelashes , eyebrows , and also the <unk> and <unk> of the eyelids , are colored black .
The <unk> , and sometimes other parts of the feet , as high as the <unk> , the <unk> of the hands , and the <unk> , are dyed with a <unk> , with the leaves of a plant called <unk> ( _ <unk> inermis _ ) , the <unk> of which somewhat resembles the myrtle , and is dried for the purposes above mentioned .
The back of the hand is also often colored and ornamented in this way with different devices .
On <unk> they paint their cheeks of a red <unk> color , a narrow red line being also drawn down the temples .
In Greece , &quot; for coloring the lashes and sockets of the eye they throw incense or gum <unk> on some <unk> of fire , <unk> the smoke which <unk> with a plate , and collect the soot .
This I saw applied .
A <unk> , <unk> <unk> as usual on a <unk> , and <unk> one of her eyes , took the two lashes between the <unk> and <unk> of her left hand , <unk> them forward , and then , <unk> in at the <unk> <unk> a sort of <unk> or probe which had been <unk> in the soot , and <unk> it , the particles previously adhering to the probe remained within the eyelashes . &quot;
<unk> &apos;S _ <unk> in Greece . _ Dr. <unk> states that among other curiosities that were taken out of the tombs at <unk> relating to Egyptian women , he saw a <unk> of the common <unk> , which contained one of these <unk> and an ounce or more of this powder .
In England the same practice is adopted by many persons that have gray hair ; but instead of using the black material in the form of a powder , it is employed as a <unk> , the color being mixed with a greasy body , such as the brown and black <unk> pomatums , described in the previous article .
<unk> HAIR DYE .
In Constantinople there are some persons , particularly Armenians , who <unk> themselves to the preparation of cosmetics , and obtain large <unk> of money from those desirous of <unk> this art .
Amongst these cosmetics is a black dye for the hair , which , according to <unk> , is prepared in the following manner : -- <unk> <unk> galls are <unk> with a little oil to a paste , which is <unk> in an iron pan until the oil vapors cease to evolve , upon which the residue is triturated with water into a paste , and heated again to dryness .
At the same time a metallic mixture , which is brought from Egypt to the commercial <unk> of the East , and which is termed in <unk> _ <unk> _ , or _ <unk> _ , is employed for this purpose .
This metal , which looks like <unk> , is by some Armenians <unk> fused , and consists of iron and copper .
It obtains its name from its use for the coloration of the hair , and particularly the <unk> _ <unk> _ means eyebrows , and _ <unk> _ stone .
The fine powder of this metal is as <unk> mixed as possible with the moistened <unk> into a paste , which is preserved in a damp place , by which it acquires the blackening property .
In some cases this mass is mixed with , the powder of odorous substances which are used in the <unk> as perfumes , and called _ <unk> _ , that is , pleasant odor ; and of these the principal ingredient is ambergris .
To blacken the hair a little of this dye is triturated in the hand or between the fingers , with which the hair or <unk> is well rubbed .
After a few days the hair becomes very beautifully black , and it is a real pleasure to see such fine black <unk> as are met with in the East among the <unk> who use this black dye .
Another and important advantage in the use of this dye consists therein , that the hair remains soft , pliant , and for a long time black , when it has been once dyed with this substance .
That the coloring properties of this dye are to be chiefly ascribed to the <unk> acid , which can be found by treating the mass with water , may be with certainty assumed .
<unk> HAIR DYE .
Powdered litharge , 2 lbs .
<unk> , 1 / 2 lb .
<unk> magnesia , 1 / 2 lb .
<unk> the lime , using as little water as possible to make it <unk> , then mix the whole by a sieve .
ANOTHER <unk> .
<unk> lime , 3 lbs .
White lead in powder , 2 lbs .

Mix by sifting , bottle , and well <unk> .
_ Directions _ to be sold with the <unk> &quot; Mix the powder with enough water to form a thick creamy fluid ; with the aid of a small brush ; completely cover the hair to be dyed with this mixture ; to dye a light brown , allow it to remain on the hair four hours ; dark brown , eight hours ; black , twelve hours .
As the dye does not act unless it is moist , it is necessary to keep it so by <unk> an oiled silk , <unk> , or other <unk> <unk> .
&quot; After the hair is dyed , the refuse must be thoroughly washed from the head with plain water ; when dry , the hair must be oiled . &quot;
SIMPLE <unk> DYE .
( _ Otherwise &quot; <unk> <unk> . _ &quot; ) Nitrate of silver , 1 oz .
Rose-water , 1 pint .
Before using this dye it is necessary to free the hair from grease by washing it with soda or pearlash and water .
The hair must be quite dry prior to applying the dye , which is best laid on with an old <unk> .
This dye does not &quot; <unk> &quot; for several hours .
It needs scarcely be observed that its effects are more rapidly produced by <unk> the hair to sunshine and air .
HAIR DYE , WITH MORDANT .
( _ Brown . _ ) Nitrate of silver , 1 oz . , blue bottles .
Rose-water , 9 oz . &quot;
_ The mordant _ .--Sulphuret of potassium , 1 oz . , white bottles . &quot;
Water , 8 oz . &quot;
HAIR DYE , WITH MORDANT .
( _ Black . _ ) Nitrate of silver , 1 oz . , blue bottles .
Water , 6 oz . &quot;
_ The mordant _ .--Sulphuret of potassium , 1 oz . , white bottles . &quot;
Water , 6 oz . &quot;
The mordant is to be applied to the hair first ; when dry , the silver solution .
Great care must be taken that the sulphuret is fresh made , or at least , well preserved in closed bottles , otherwise , instead of the mordant acting to make to make the hair black , it will <unk> to impart a _ yellow _ hue .
When the mordant is good , it has a very disagreeable odor , and although this is the <unk> and best dye , its unpleasant smell has given rise to the <unk> DYE .
_ Blue bottles . _ --Dissolve the nitrate of silver in the water as in the above , then add liquid ammonia by degrees until the mixture becomes cloudy from the precipitate of the oxide of silver , continue to add ammonia in small portions until the fluid again becomes bright from the oxide of silver being <unk> .
_ White bottles _ <unk> half a pint of boiling rose-water upon three ounces of powdered <unk> ; when cold , strain and bottle .
This forms the mordant , and is used in the same way as the first-named dye , like the sulphuret mordant .
It is not so good a dye as the previous one .
FRENCH BROWN DYE .
_ Blue Bottles _ .--Saturated solution of sulphate of copper ; to this add ammonia enough to precipitate the oxide of copper and <unk> it ( as with the silver in the above ) , producing the <unk> liquid .
_ White Bottles _ <unk> _ <unk> _ .--Saturated solution of <unk> of potass .
Artificial hair , for the manufacture of <unk> , is dyed in the same manner as wool .
There are in the market several other hair dyes , but all of them are but modifications of the above , possessing no marked advantage .
<unk> DYE .
Liquid hair dye , not to blacken the skin , may be thus prepared : --Dissolve in one ounce of liquor potassÃ¦ as much <unk> oxide of lead as it will take up , and dilute the resulting clear solution with three ounces of distilled water .
<unk> must be taken not to wet the skin unnecessarily with it .
<unk> DEPILATORY OR <unk> .
( _ For removing hair . _ ) As the ladies of this country consider the growth of hair upon the upper lip , upon the <unk> , and on the back of the <unk> , to be detrimental to beauty , those who are troubled with such physical <unk> of good health and vital stamina have long had recourse to rusma or depilatory for removing it .
This or analogous preparations were introduced into this country from the East , rusma having been in use in the <unk> of Asia for many ages .
Best lime slaked , 3 lb .
<unk> , in powder , 1 / 2 lbs .
Mix the material by means of a <unk> sieve ; preserve the same for sale in <unk> or stoppered bottles .
_ Directions _ to be sold with the above .
Mix the depilatory powder with enough water to render it of a creamy consistency ; lay it upon the hair for about five minutes , or until its caustic action upon the skin renders it necessary to be removed ; a similar process to shaving is then to be gone through , but instead of using a <unk> , operate with an ivory or bone <unk> ; then wash the part with plenty of water , and apply a little cold cream .
The <unk> time to leave depilatory upon the part to be <unk> cannot be given , because there is a physical difference in the nature of hair .
&quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; require more time than &quot; <unk> <unk> ; &quot; the <unk> of the skin has also to be considered .
A small <unk> is a very good test for its action .
A few readers will , perhaps , be <unk> in <unk> that I have only given one formula for depilatory .
The receipts might easily have been increased in number , but not in quality .
The use of <unk> compounds is objectionable , but it undoubtedly increases the <unk> action of the compounds .
A few <unk> of &quot; <unk> <unk> , &quot; &quot; <unk> to Pharmacopoeias , &quot; and others , add to the lime &quot; charcoal powder , &quot; &quot; carbonate of potass , &quot; &quot; starch , &quot; &amp; c . ; but what action have these <unk> hair ?
The simplest depilatory is moistened <unk> , but it is less <unk> than the mixture recommended above ; it answers very well for <unk> and <unk> , with whom time is no object .
SECTION XIV .
ABSORBENT POWDERS .
A lady &apos;s <unk> is incomplete without a box of some absorbent powder ; indeed , from our earliest <unk> , powder is used for drying the skin with the greatest benefit ; no <unk> that its use is continued in <unk> years , if , by slight modifications in its composition , it can be employed not only as an absorbent , but as a means of &quot; personal adornment . &quot;
We are quite within <unk> in stating that many <unk> of such powders are used in this country annually .
They are principally composed of various <unk> , prepared from wheat , potatoes , and various nuts , mixed more or less with powdered <unk> <unk> , <unk> ( <unk> ) , French chalk , oxide of bismuth , and oxide of zinc , &amp; c . The most popular is what is termed VIOLET POWDER .
Wheat starch , 12 lbs .
Orris-root powder , 2 lbs .
Otto of lemon , 1 / 2 oz . &quot;
bergamot , 3 / 4 oz . &quot;
cloves , 2 drachms .
ROSE FACE POWDER .
Wheat starch , 7 lbs .
Rose Pink , 1 / 2 drachm .
Otto of rose , 2 drachms . &quot;
santal , 2 &quot; <unk> OR <unk> HAIR POWDER Is pure wheat starch .
FACE POWDER .
Starch , 1 lb .
Oxide of <unk> , 4 oz .
PERLE POWDER .
French chalk , 1 lb .
Oxide of bismuth , 1 oz .
Oxide of zinc , 1 oz .
BLANC DE PERLE Is pure oxide of bismuth in powder .
FRENCH BLANC Is levigated talc passed through a silk sieve .
This is the best face powder made , particularly as it does not <unk> from <unk> of the skin or impure atmosphere .
<unk> BLANC ( FOR <unk> USE ) .
The use of a white paint by <unk> and <unk> , is <unk> necessary ; great <unk> produces a <unk> complexion , which is incompatible with certain <unk> effects , and requires a cosmetic to <unk> it .
<unk> <unk> , during her <unk> <unk> , has probably consumed more than half a <unk> of oxide of bismuth , prepared thus : -- Rose or orange-flower water , 1 pint .
Oxide of bismuth , 4 oz .
Mixed by long trituration .
<unk> <unk> Is also extensively used as a toilet powder , and is sold under various names ; it is not so unctuous as the ordinary kind .
<unk> AND <unk> <unk> .
These preparations are in demand , not only for <unk> use , but by <unk> <unk> .
Various shades of color are made , to <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and <unk> .
One of the best kind is that termed <unk> OF ROSES .
Strong liquid ammonia , 1 / 2 oz .
Finest carmine , 1 / 4 oz .
Rose-water , 1 pint .
Esprit de rose ( triple ) , 1 / 2 oz .
Place the carmine into a pint bottle , and pour on it the ammonia ; allow them to remain together , with occasional agitation , for two days ; then add the rose-water and esprit , and well mix .
Place the bottle in a quiet situation for a week ; any precipitate of impurities from the carmine will subside ; the supernatant &quot; Bloom of Roses &quot; is then to be bottled for sale .
If the carmine was perfectly pure there would be no precipitate ; nearly all the carmine purchased from the makers is more or less <unk> , its enormous price being a <unk> to its adulteration .
<unk> cannot be manufactured _ profitably _ on a small scale for commercial purposes ; four or five manufacturers supply the whole of Europe !
M. Titard , <unk> <unk> St. <unk> , Paris , produces , without doubt , the finest article ; singular enough , however , the principal operative in the establishment is an old Englishman .
&quot; The preparation of the finest carmine is still a mystery , because , on the one hand , its consumption being very limited , few persons are <unk> in its manufacture , and , upon the other , the raw material being costly , extensive experiments on it cannot be <unk> made . &quot; --DR .
<unk> .
In the _ <unk> <unk> _ will be found no less than a dozen recipes for preparing carmine ; the number of formulÃ¦ will <unk> the most superficial reader that the true form is yet <unk> .
<unk> has <unk> us its exact composition ; but a certain <unk> of manipulation and proper temperature are <unk> to complete success .
Most of the recipes given by Dr. <unk> , and others , are from this source ; but as they possess no practical value we <unk> from <unk> them .
TOILET <unk> .
Are prepared of different shades by mixing fine carmine with talc powder , in different proportions , say , one drachm of carmine to two ounces of talc , or one of carmine to three of talc , and so on .
These rouges are sold in powder , and also in cake or <unk> pots ; for the latter the rouge is mixed with a minute portion of solution of gum tragacanth .
M. Titard <unk> a great variety of rouges .
In some instances the coloring-matter of the <unk> is spread upon thick paper and dried very gradually ; it then assumes a beautiful green tint .
This curious <unk> effect is also observed in &quot; pink saucers . &quot;
What is known as Chinese book rouge is evidently made in the same way , and has been imported into this country for many years .
When the <unk> green <unk> are moistened with a piece of damp cotton wool , and applied to the <unk> or cheeks , the color assumes a beautiful <unk> hue .
<unk> sorts of rouge , called &quot; <unk> rouge , &quot; are made from the <unk> lake ; another kind is derived from the safflower ( _ <unk> <unk> _ ) ; from this plant also is made PINK <unk> .
The safflower is washed in water until the yellow coloring-matter is removed ; the <unk> or color principle is then dissolved out by a weak solution of carbonate of soda ; the coloring is then precipitated into the saucers by the addition of sulphuric acid to the solution .
Cotton wool and <unk> being colored in the same way are used for the same purpose , the former being sold as Spanish wool , the latter as <unk> rouge .
SECTION XV .
TOOTH POWDERS AND MOUTH WASHES .
TOOTH powders , regarded as a means merely of <unk> the teeth , are most commonly placed among cosmetics ; but this should not be , as they assist greatly in preserving a healthy and regular condition of the dental <unk> , and so aid in <unk> as much as possible the act of <unk> .
In this manner , they may be considered as most useful , although it is true , <unk> medicinal agents .
By a careful and <unk> use of them , some of the most frequent causes of early loss of the teeth may be prevented ; these are , the <unk> of tartar , the swelling of the gums , and an <unk> <unk> of the saliva .
The effect resulting from <unk> of the tartar is well known to most persons , and it has been <unk> shown that swelling of the substance of the gums will <unk> the expulsion of the teeth from their sockets ; and the action of the saliva , if <unk> acid , is known to be at least injurious , if not <unk> .
Now , the daily employment of a tooth powder sufficiently hard , so as to <unk> a <unk> degree of <unk> upon the teeth , without , at the same time , <unk> the <unk> of the teeth , will , in most cases , almost always prevent the tartar <unk> in such a degree as to cause subsequent <unk> to the teeth ; and a <unk> , spongy , <unk> condition of the gums may be prevented or overcome by adding to such a tooth powder , some <unk> and astringent ingredient .
A tooth powder containing charcoal and <unk> bark , will <unk> these results in most cases , and therefore <unk> generally recommend such .
Still , there are <unk> to the use of charcoal ; it is too hard and <unk> , its color is objectionable , and it is perfectly insoluble by the saliva , it is <unk> to become <unk> between the teeth , and there to collect decomposing animal and vegetable matter around such particles as may be fixed in this position .
<unk> bark , too , is often <unk> , and has a bitter , disagreeable taste .
M. <unk> highly recommends the following formula : -- MIALHE &apos;S TOOTH POWDER .
<unk> of milk , one thousand parts ; lake , ten parts ; pure tannin , fifteen parts ; oil of mint , oil of aniseed , and oil of orange flowers , so much as to impart an agreeable flavor to the composition .
His directions for the preparation of this tooth powder , are , to rub well the lake with the tannin , and gradually add the sugar of milk , previously powdered and sifted ; and lastly , the essential oils are to be carefully mixed with the powdered substances .
<unk> has convinced him of the <unk> of this tooth powder , the <unk> employment of which , will <unk> to preserve the gums and teeth in a healthy state .
For those who are troubled with <unk> <unk> and <unk> of the gums , he recommends the following astringent preparation : -- MIALHE &apos;S <unk> .
Alcohol , one thousand parts ; genuine kino , one hundred parts ; rhatany root , one hundred parts ; tincture of balsam of tolu , two parts ; tincture of gum benzoin , two parts ; essential oil of <unk> , two parts ; essential oil of mint , two parts ; essential oil of aniseed , one part .
The kino and the rhatany root are to be macerated in the alcohol for seven or eight days ; and after filtration , the other articles are to be added .
A <unk> of this preparation mixed in three or four <unk> of water , should be used to <unk> the mouth , after the use of the tooth powder .

&#91; Illustration &#93; APPENDIX .
* * * * * MANUFACTURE OF GLYCERINE .
Glycerine is generally made on the large scale , on the one hand , by directly saponifying oil with the oxide of lead , or , on the other , from the &quot; waste liquor &quot; of soap manufacturers .
To obtain glycerine by means of the first of these methods is the <unk> of simple , and at the same time somewhat expensive ; and by means of the second process , the difficulty of entirely separating the <unk> matters of the waste liquor renders it next to impossible to procure a perfectly pure result .
To meet both these difficulties , and to meet the <unk> increasing demand for glycerine , Dr. <unk> <unk> recommends the following process , which , he <unk> , he has found , by experience , to <unk> the desirable <unk> of economy as regards time , trouble , and expense .
One hundred pounds of oil , tallow , lard , or <unk> are to be placed in a clean <unk> barrel , and melted by the direct application of a current of steam .
<unk> still fluid and warm , add to it fifteen pounds of lime , previously slaked , and made into a milky mixture with two and a half gallons of water ; then cover the vessel , and continue the <unk> for several hours , or until the saponification shall be completed .
This may be known when a sample of the soap when cold gives a smooth and bright surface on being scraped with the <unk> , and at the same time , <unk> with a <unk> <unk> .
By this process the fat or oil is decomposed , its acids uniting with the lime to form insoluble <unk> , while the eliminated glycerine remains in solution in the water along with the excess of the lime .
After it has been sufficiently boiled , it is allowed to cool and to settle , and it is then to be strained .
The strained liquid contains only the glycerine and excess of lime , and requires to be carefully concentrated by heated steam .
During evaporation , a portion of the lime is <unk> , on account of its <unk> solubility in hot than in cold water .
The residue is removed by treating the evaporated liquid with a current of carbonic acid gas , boiling by heated steam to convert a soluble bicarbonate of lime that may have been formed into insoluble neutral carbonate , decanting or straining off the clear supernatant liquid from the precipitated carbonate of lime , and evaporating still further , as before , if necessary , so as to drive off any excess of water .
As nothing fixed or injurious is employed in this process , glycerine , prepared in this manner , may be <unk> upon for its almost absolute purity .
M. Jahn &apos;s process is as follows : -- Take of <unk> litharge five pounds , and olive oil nine pounds .
Boil them together over a gentle fire , constantly stirring , with the addition occasionally of a small quantity of warm water , until the compound has the consistence of plaster .
Jahn boils this plaster for half an hour with an equal weight of water , keeping it at the same time constantly stirred .
When cold , he pours off the supernatant fluid , and <unk> the boiling three times at least with a fresh portion of water .
The sweet <unk> which result are mixed , and evaporated to six pounds , and sulphuretted hydrogen conducted through them as long as sulphuret of lead is precipitated .
The liquid filtered from the sulphuret of lead is to be reduced to a thin syrupy consistence by evaporation .
To remove the brown coloring matter , it must be treated with purified animal charcoal .
However , this agent does not prevent the glycerine becoming slightly colored upon further evaporation .
It possesses also still a slight smell and taste of lead plaster , which may be removed by diluting it with water , and by digestion with animal charcoal , and some fresh <unk> charcoal .
After filtration , this liquid must be evaporated until it has acquired a specific gravity of <unk> , when it will be found to be free from smell , and of a pale yellow color .
For the preparation of glycerine , distilled water is necessary , to prevent it being contaminated with the impurities of common water .
Jahn obtained , by this method , from the above quantity of lead plaster , upwards of seven ounces of <unk> _ Archives der Pharmacie _ .
* * * * * <unk> FOR <unk> IN ESSENTIAL OILS .
<unk> <unk> recommends for this purpose acetate of potash .
When to an ethereal oil , contaminated with alcohol , dry acetate of potash is added , this salt dissolves in the alcohol , and forms a solution from which the volatile oil separates .
If the oil be free from alcohol , this salt remains dry therein .
<unk> , who speaks highly of this test , has suggested the following method of applying it as the best : <unk> a dry test-tube , about half an inch in diameter , and five or six inches long , put no more than eight <unk> of powdered dry acetate of potash ; then <unk> the tube two-thirds full with the essential oil to be examined .
The contents of the tube must be well stirred with a glass rod , <unk> care not to allow the salt to rise above the oil ; afterwards set <unk> for a short time .
If the salt be found at the bottom of the tube dry , it is evident that the oil contains no spirit .
<unk> , instead of the dry salt , <unk> the oil is found a clear syrupy fluid , which is a solution of the salt in the spirit , with which the oil was mixed .
When the oil contains only a little spirit , a small portion of the solid salt will be found under the syrupy solution .
Many essential oils frequently contain a trace of water , which does not <unk> interfere with this test , because , although the acetate of potash becomes moist thereby , it still retains its <unk> form .
A still more certain result may be obtained by distillation in a water-bath .
All the essential oils which have a higher boiling-point than spirit , remain in the retort , whilst the spirit passes into the receiver with only a trace of the oil , where the alcohol may be recognized by the smell and taste .
<unk> , however , a doubt exist , add to the distillate a little acetate of potash and strong sulphuric acid , and heat the mixture in a test-tube to the boiling-point , when the characteristic odor of acetic ether will be <unk> , if any alcohol be present .

It is known that the olein of the drying oils may be distinguished from the olein of those oils which remain greasy in the air by the first not being <unk> into <unk> acid , consequently it does not become solid .
Professor <unk> has recently <unk> a convenient method for the formation of elaidin , which is applicable for the purpose of <unk> the adulteration of almond and olive oils with drying oils .

It is well known that most ethereal oils are colorless ; however , there are a great number colored , some of which are blue , some green , and some yellow .
<unk> to the present time the question has not been decided , whether it is the necessary property of ethereal oils to have a color , or whether their color is not due to the presence of some coloring matter which can be removed .
It is most probable that their color arises from the presence of a foreign substance , as the colored ethereal oils can at first , by careful distillation , be obtained colorless , whilst later the colored portion passes over .
<unk> <unk> lead to the solution of the question , and are certain <unk> that ethereal oils , when they are colored , owe their color to peculiar substances which , by certain conditions , may be <unk> from one oil to another .

Some years since , <unk> has shown that styrone , which is obtained when <unk> is treated with potash , is the alcohol of cinnamic acid .
<unk> has converted this alcohol by oxidizing agents into cinnamic acid .
The author has now proved that under the same conditions by which ordinary alcohol affords aldehyde , styrone affords the aldehyde of cinnamic acid , that is , oil of cinnamon .
It is only necessary to <unk> platinum black with styrone , and let it remain in the air some days , when by means of the <unk> of potash the aldehyde double compound may be obtained in crystals , which should be washed in ether .
By the addition of diluted sulphuric acid , the aldehyde of cinnamic acid is afterwards procured pure .
These crystals also dissolve in nitric acid , and then form after a few <unk> crystals of the nitrate of the hyduret of cinnamyle .
The <unk> of styrone into the hyduret of cinnamyle by the action of the platinum black is shown by the following <unk> : C _ { 18 } H _ { 10 } O _ { 2 } + 2 O = C _ { 18 } H _ { 8 } O _ { 2 } + 2 <unk> _ <unk> <unk> . _ * * * * * DETECTION OF <unk> OIL AND <unk> IN LAVENDER OIL BY DR. <unk> <unk> .
There are two kinds of lavender oil known in commerce ; one , which is very <unk> , and is obtained from the flowers of the _ Lavandula vera _ ; the other is much cheaper , and is prepared from the flowers of the _ Lavandula spica _ .
The latter is generally termed oil of spike .
In the south of France , whether the oil be distilled from the flowers of the _ Lavandula vera _ or _ Lavandula spica _ , it is named oil of lavender .
By the distillation of the whole plant or only the stalk and the leaves , a small quantity of oil is obtained , which is rich in camphor , and is there called oil of spike .
Pure oil of lavender should have a specific gravity from <unk> to <unk> , and be completely soluble in five parts of alcohol of a specific gravity of <unk> .
A greater specific gravity shows that it is mixed with oil of spike ; and a less solubility , that it contains oil of turpentine .

The first is distilled from the flowers ; the second is made with distilled water and neroli ; and the third is distilled from the leaves , the stems , and the young unripe fruit of the orange tree .
The first may be easily distinguished by the addition of a few drops of sulphuric acid to some of the water in a tube ; a fine rose color is almost immediately produced .
The second also gives the same color when it is freshly prepared ; but after a certain time , two or three months at the <unk> , this color is no longer produced , and the aroma disappears completely .

The strength of spirit of wine is , by law , regulated by proof spirit ( sp .
gr .
.920 ) as a <unk> ; and accordingly as it is either stronger or weaker than the above , it is called so much per cent .
above or below proof .
The term _ per cent . _ is used in this instance in a rather peculiar sense .
Thus , spirit of wine at 56 per cent .
overproof , signifies that 100 gallons of it are equal to <unk> gallons of proof spirit ; while a spirit at 20 per cent .
underproof , signifies that 100 gallons are equal to 80 gallons at proof .
The rectified spirit of the Pharmacopoeia is 56 per cent .
overproof , and may be reduced to proof by strictly adhering to the directions there given , <unk> . , to mix five measures with three of water .
The result , however , will not be eight measures of proof spirit ; in consequence of the _ contraction _ which ensues , there will be a <unk> of about &#91; <unk> : oz .
&#93; <unk> in each gallon .
This must be borne in mind in preparing tinctures .
During a long series of experiments on the preparation of ethers , it appeared a <unk> to find a ready method of ascertaining how much spirit of any density would be equal to one chemical equivalent of absolute alcohol .
By a modification of a rule employed by the Excise , this question may be easily <unk> .
The Excise rule is as follows : -- To reduce from any given strength to any required strength , _ add _ the _ overproof _ per centage _ to _ 100 , or _ <unk> _ the _ underproof _ per centage _ from _ 100 .
<unk> the result by the quantity of spirit , and divide the product by the number obtained by _ adding _ the _ required _ per centage overproof , or _ <unk> _ the _ required _ per centage underproof , to or from 100 , as the case may be .
The result will give the measure of the spirit at the strength required .
Thus , suppose you <unk> to reduce 10 gallons of spirit , at 54 overproof , down to proof , add 54 to 100 = 154 ; <unk> by the quantity , 10 gallons ( 154 Ã 10 ) = 1540 .
The required strength being proof , of course there is nothing either to add to or take from 100 ; therefore , 1540 divided by 100 = <unk> gallons at proof ; showing that 10 gallons must be made to measure 15 gallons , 3 pints , 4 <unk> .
oz . , by the addition of water .
To ascertain what quantity of spirit of any given strength will contain one equivalent of absolute alcohol .
Add the overproof per centage of the given spirit to 100 , as before ; and with the number thus obtained divide 4062.183 .
The result gives in gallons the quantity equal to four equivalents ( 46 Ã 4 ) .
_ <unk> . _ <unk> much spirit at 54 per cent .
overproof is equal to 1 equivalent of absolute alcohol ?
Here , 54 + 100 = 154 and 4062.183 = <unk> galls . , or 26 galls .
3 <unk> .
<unk> 154 which , divided by 4 , gives 6 gallons , 4 pints , 15 oz .
<unk> the spirit to be 60 overproof , -- 4062.183 { one-fourth of which is equal then <unk> = <unk> gallons , { to 6 gallons , 2 pints , ( 100 + 60 ) { <unk> / 2 oz .
This rule is founded on the following data .
As a gallon of water <unk> 10 lbs . , it is obvious that the specific gravity of any liquid <unk> by 10 will give the weight of one gallon .
The specific gravity of absolute alcohol is <unk> ; hence , the weight of one gallon will be 7.93811 lbs . , and its strength is estimated at 75.25 overproof .
4 equivalents of alcohol = 46 Ã 4 = <unk> , and 23.17936 gallons Ã 7.93811 lbs .
per gallon , also = <unk> .
Hence it appears that 23.17936 gallons of absolute alcohol are equal to 4 equivalents .
By adding the overproof per centage ( 75.25 ) to 100 , and <unk> by the quantity ( 23.17936 gallons ) we get the constant number 4062.183 .
The rule might have been calculated so as to show _ at once _ the equivalent , without dividing by 4 ; but it would have required several more places of <unk> ; it will give the required quantity to a <unk> of a fluid drachm .

Instead of <unk> to repeated distillations for effecting the purification of spirits , Mr. <unk> <unk> the use of a filter .
In a suitable vessel , the form of which is not material , a filtering bed is constructed in the following manner : <unk> a false perforated bottom , covered with woollen or other fabric , a layer of about six inches of <unk> and very clean <unk> sand is placed ; next about twelve inches of granular charcoal , preferring that made from birch ; on the charcoal is placed a layer of about one inch of wheat , boiled to such an extent as to cause it to swell as large as possible , and so that it will readily crush between the fingers .
<unk> this is laid about ten inches of charcoal , then about one inch of broken <unk> <unk> , and then about two inches more of charcoal , over which is placed a layer of woollen or other fabric , and over it a perforated <unk> , on to which the spirit to be filtered is poured ; the filter is kept covered , and in order that the spirit may flow freely into the compartment of the filter below the filtering materials , a tube <unk> such lower compartment with the upper compartment of the filter , so that the air may pass freely between the lower and upper <unk> of the filter .
On each , of the several <unk> above described , it is desirable to place a layer of filtering paper .
The charcoal suitable for the above purpose is not such as is obtained in the ordinary mode of preparation .

The charcoal being <unk> of the water is then reduced to a granular state , in which condition it is ready for use .
* * * * * ON ESSENTIAL OIL OR OTTO OF <unk> .
BY <unk> S. COBB .
( _ <unk> before the Chemical <unk> Society . _ ) I have recently made some experiments with oil of lemons , of which the following is a short account : -- Being constantly <unk> by the deposit and alteration in my essence of lemons , I have tried various methods of <unk> the <unk> .
I first tried <unk> it , but besides the loss consequent on distilling small quantities , the flavor is thereby <unk> .
As the oil <unk> <unk> when heated , I anticipated that all its <unk> matter would be thrown down at a low temperature , and I applied a <unk> mixture , keeping the oil at <unk> for some hours .
No such change , however , took place .
The plan which I ultimately decided upon as the best which I had <unk> at , was to <unk> up the oil with a little boiling water , and to leave the water in the bottle ; a mucilaginous preparation forms on the top of the water , and acquires a certain <unk> , so that the oil may be poured off to nearly the last , without <unk> the deposit .
Perhaps cold water would answer equally well , were it carefully agitated with the oil and allowed some time to settle .
A consideration of its origin and constitution , indeed , <unk> this opinion ; for although lemon otto is obtained both by distillation and expression , that which is usually found in commerce is prepared by removing the &quot; <unk> &quot; of lemons with a <unk> , and afterwards <unk> it in a hair sack , allowing the filtrate to stand , that it may deposit some of its impurities , decanting and filtering .
Thus obtained it still contains a certain amount of mucilaginous matter , which undergoes <unk> decomposition , and thus ( acting , in short , as a ferment ) <unk> a similar change in the oil itself .
If this view of its decomposition be a correct one , we evidently , in removing this matter by means of the water , get <unk> of a great source of alteration , and attain the same result as we should by distillation , without its waste or <unk> in flavor .
I am , however , aware that some consider the deposit to be modified resin .
&#91; H &#93; Some curious experiments of <unk> have shown that volatile oils absorb oxygen immediately they have been drawn from the plant , and are partially converted into a resin , which remains dissolved in the remainder of the essence .
He remarked that this property of absorbing oxygen gradually increases , until a maximum is attained , and again <unk> after a certain <unk> of time .
In the oil of lavender this maximum remained only seven days , during each of which it absorbed seven times its volume of oxygen .
In the oil of lemons the maximum was not attained until at the end of a month ; it then <unk> twenty-six days ; during each of which it absorbed twice its volume of oxygen .
The oil of turpentine did not attain the maximum for five months , it then remained for one month , during which time it absorbed daily its own volume of oxygen .
It is the resin formed by the absorption of oxygen , and remaining dissolved in the essence , which <unk> its original flavor .
The oil of lemons <unk> a very great analogy with that of oil of turpentine , so far as regards its transformations , and its power of rotating a ray of polarized light .
<unk> differ as regards this latter property .
Pereira states that the oil of turpentine obtained by distillation with water , from American turpentine , has a molecular power of <unk> rotation , while the French oil of turpentine had a <unk> rotation .
Oil of lemons rotates a ray of light to the right , but in France a distilled oil of lemons , sold as <unk> drops for removing spots of grease , possesses quite the opposite power of rotation , and has lost all the original peculiar flavor of the oil .
Oil of lemons combines with hydrochloric acid to form an artificial camphor , just in the same manner as does oil of turpentine , but its atom is only one half that of the oil of turpentine .
The artificial camphor of oil of lemons is <unk> by the formula , C _ { 10 } H _ { 8 } HCl ; the artificial camphor of oil of turpentine by C _ { 20 } H _ { 16 } HCl .
According to M. <unk> , the camphor formed by the oil of lemons does not exercise any action on polarized light , whilst the oil of lemons itself rotates a ray to the right .
The camphor from oil of turpentine , on the contrary , does exercise on the polarized ray the same power as the oil possessed while in its isolated state , of rotating to the left .
These molecular properties establish an essential difference between the oils of turpentine and lemons , and may serve to detect adulteration and fraud .
It is also a curious fact , that from the decomposition of these artificial camphors by lime , volatile oils may be obtained by distillation , <unk> with the original oils from which the camphors were formed ; but in neither case has the new product any action on polarized light .
In conclusion , I would recommend that this oil , as well as all other essential oils , be kept in a cool , dark place , where no very great <unk> of temperature occur .
* * * * * <unk> ACID , AND <unk> FOR ITS <unk> .
BY W. BASTICK .
Dr. Mohr &apos;s process for obtaining benzoic acid , which is adopted by the <unk> Pharmacopoeia , <unk> has the reputation of being the best .
According to this process , <unk> gum benzoin is to be <unk> on the flat bottom of a round iron pot which has a diameter of nine inches , and a height of about two inches .
On the surface of the pot is spread a piece of filtering paper , which is <unk> to its <unk> by starch paste .
A <unk> of very thick paper is attached by means of a <unk> to the top of the iron pot .
<unk> is then applied by placing the pot on a plate covered with sand , over the mouth of a <unk> .
It must remain exposed to a gentle fire from four to six hours .
Mohr usually obtains about an ounce and a half of benzoic acid from twelve ounces of gum benzoin by the first sublimation .
As the gum is not <unk> by the first operation , it may be bruised when cold and again submitted to the action of heat , when a fresh portion of benzoic acid will sublime from it .
This acid thus obtained , is not perfectly pure and white , and Mohr states that it is a question , in a medicinal and perfumery point of view , whether it is so valuable when perfectly pure , as when it contains a small portion of a fragrant volatile oil , which rises with it from the gum in the process of sublimation .
The London Pharmacopoeia <unk> that it shall be prepared by sublimation , and does not <unk> that it shall be free from this oil , to which it principally owes its agreeable odor .
By the second sublimation the whole of the benzoic acid is not volatilized .
What remains in the resin may be separated by boiling it with caustic lime , and <unk> the acid from the resulting <unk> of lime with hydrochloric acid .
Benzoic acid can be obtained also in the wet way , and the resin yields a greater product in this process than in the former ; yet it has a less perfumery value , because it is free from the volatile oil which , as above stated , gives it its peculiar odor .
The wet method <unk> by Scheele is as follows : <unk> one ounce of <unk> lime into a milk with from four to six ounces of hot water .
To the milk of lime , four ounces of powdered benzoin and <unk> ounces of water are to be added , and the mixture boiled for half an hour , and stirred during this operation , and afterwards strained through linen .
The residue must be a second time boiled with twenty ounces of water and strained , and a third time with ten ounces ; the fluid products must be mixed and evaporated to one-fourth of their volume , and sufficient hydrochloric acid added to render them slightly acid .
When quite cold , the crystals are to be separated from the fluid by means of a linen <unk> , upon which they are to be washed with cold water , and pressed , and then dissolved in hot distilled water , from which the crystals separate on cooling .
When hydrochloric acid is added to a cold concentrated solution of the salts of benzoic acid , it is precipitated as a white powder .
If the solution of the salts of this acid is too dilute and warm , none or only a portion of the benzoic acid will be separated .
However , the weaker the solution is , and the more slowly it is cooled , the larger will be the crystals of this acid .
In the preparation of this acid in the wet way , lime is to be preferred to every other base , because it forms insoluble combinations with the resinous <unk> of the benzoin , and because it prevents the gum-resin from <unk> into an <unk> mass , and also because an excess of this base is but slightly soluble .
<unk> has recommended a method by which all the acid can be removed from the benzoin : --The resin is to be dissolved in spirit , to which is to be added a watery solution of carbonate of soda , decomposed previously by alcohol .
The spirit is to be removed by distillation , and the remaining watery solution , from which the resin has been separated by filtration , treated with dilute sulphuric acid , to precipitate the benzoic acid .
This method gives the greatest quantity of acid , but is attended with a <unk> of time and alcohol , which renders it in an economical point of view inferior to the above process of Scheele .
It is so far valuable , that the total acid contents of the resin can be determined by it .
Dr. <unk> considers the following process for obtaining benzoic acid the most <unk> .
Dissolve benzoin in strong alcohol , by the aid of heat , and add to the solution , whilst hot , hydrochloric acid , in sufficient quantity to precipitate the resin .
When the mixture is distilled , the benzoic acid passes over in the form of benzoic ether .
Distillation must be continued as long as any ether passes over .
Water added towards the end of the operation will <unk> the expulsion of the ether from the retort .
When the ether ceases to pass over , the hot water in the retort is filtered , which deposits benzoic acid on cooling .
The benzoic ether and all the distilled liquids are now treated with caustic potash until the ether is decomposed , and the solution is heated to boiling , and <unk> with hydrochloric acid , which afterwards , on cooling , deposits , in crystals , benzoic acid .
Benzoic acid , as it exists in the resin , is the natural production of the plant from which the resin is derived .
It may also be produced artificially .
<unk> found that when <unk> ( C _ { 18 } H _ { 12 } ) was treated with nitric acid , so dilute that no red vapors were evolved for several days , this hydro-carbon was converted into benzoic acid .
<unk> has , by the oxidation of <unk> with peroxide of manganese and sulphuric acid , obtained as one of the products benzoic acid .
<unk> , <unk> , and <unk> yielded similar results when treated as above .
<unk> has detected benzoic acid in <unk> castor , along with salicin .
It is also formed by the oxidation of the volatile oil of bitter almonds .
<unk> of potash results when chloride of <unk> is treated with caustic potash .
Benzoic acid in the animal economy is converted into <unk> acid , which may by the action of acids , be <unk> into benzoic acid .
Benzoic acid should be completely volatile , without leaving any <unk> or being <unk> when heated .
When dissolved in warm water , to which a little nitric acid has been added , nitrate of silver and chloride of <unk> should produce no precipitates .
<unk> of potash should give no <unk> to an ammoniacal solution of this acid .
When heated with an excess of caustic potash it should evolve no smell of ammonia , otherwise , it has been adulterated with <unk> <unk> .
In spirit , benzoic acid is easily soluble , and requires 200 parts of cold and 20 parts of boiling water to dissolve one part of it .
* * * * * ON THE <unk> OF FLOWERS .
BY <unk> AND <unk> .
<unk> possess only a very incomplete knowledge of the coloring matters of flowers .
Their <unk> involves difficulties which cannot be mistaken .
The matters which color flowers are <unk> ; they frequently change by the action of the reagents employed for their preparation ; and , also , very <unk> flowers owe their color to very small quantities of coloring matter .
On the nature of the coloring matters of flowers several <unk> have been expressed .
Some <unk> have assumed that flowers owe their color to only two coloring matters , one of which is termed <unk> , and the other <unk> .
<unk> will find a relation between the green coloring of leaves , the chlorophylle , and the coloring matters of flowers .
They support their opinion generally on the results of the elementary analysis of those different bodies ; but all chemists know that chlorophylle has not yet been prepared in a pure condition .
Probably , it retains various quantities of fatty and <unk> bodies .
Further , the coloring matters of flowers are scarcely known , so that it is impossible to establish <unk> supported by the necessarily <unk> composition of impure bodies .
Some time since the blue color of flowers was ascribed to the presence of indigo ; but <unk> has shown , in a certain way , that the blue substance of flowers is always reddened by acids ; and that with indigo it is quite different , which , as is known , retains its blue color even when the strongest acids are allowed to act on it .
It is thus seen that the coloring matters of flowers have <unk> only in a superficial manner been examined , and that it is important to again <unk> their complete examination , as these bodies are interesting to the chemist , because they are employed as reagents in the laboratory for the <unk> of alkalies ; and by an improved knowledge of them the <unk> might find the way by which he could give to cultivated flowers various colors .
We have believed that before <unk> their elementary analysis , methods must be carefully sought for which can be followed for the <unk> of the coloring matters of flowers , and that it should be proved whether these substances are to be considered as independent bodies , or whether they proceed from one and the same matter , which is changed in various ways by the juices of the plant .
We now <unk> the results of our first <unk> .
_ Blue Coloring Matter of Flowers ( Cyanine ) . _ --The blue coloring matter of flowers we <unk> to call cyanine .
To obtain this substance we treat the petals of _ Centauria cyanus _ , _ Viola odorata _ , or _ Iris <unk> _ , with boiling alcohol , by which the flowers are <unk> ; and the liquid acquires immediately a fine blue color .
If the coloring matter is allowed to remain some time in contact with alcohol , it is perceived that the blue of the liquid gradually disappears , and soon a yellow brown coloration takes its place .
The coloring matter has in this case suffered an actual <unk> by the prolonged action of the alcohol , but it will again assume its original color when the alcohol is allowed to evaporate in the air .
Nevertheless , the alcohol must not be allowed to remain in contact too long with the coloring matter , because the alcoholic extract will not then again assume its blue coloration by the action of oxygen .
The residue remaining from the evaporation of the alcohol is treated with water , which separates a fatty and resinous substance .
The watery solution which contains the coloring matter is then precipitated by neutral acetate of lead .
The precipitate , which possesses a beautiful green color , can be washed with plenty of water , and then decomposed with sulphuretted hydrogen ; the coloring matter passes into the watery solution , which is carefully evaporated in a water-bath ; the residue is again dissolved in absolute alcohol ; and lastly , the alcoholic solution is mixed with ether , which precipitates the cyanine in the form of blue flocks .
Cyanine is uncrystallizable , soluble in water and alcohol , insoluble in ether ; acids , and acid salts color it immediately red ; by alkalies it is , as known , colored green .
Cyanine appears to <unk> as an acid , at least it forms with lime , <unk> , <unk> , oxide of lead , &amp; c . , green compounds insoluble in water .
<unk> absorbing oxygen , as sulphurous acid , <unk> acid , and alcohols , <unk> it ; under the influence of oxygen its color is restored .
We must here mention that <unk> has prepared a beautiful blue substance from _ Centauria cyanus _ by treatment with absolute alcohol .
_ <unk> Coloring Matter . _ --We have employed alcohol to extract the substance which colors rose-red certain dahlias , roses , <unk> , &amp; c . For the <unk> of this coloring matter the method pursued is exactly as that for the preparation of cyanine .
By an <unk> comparison of the properties of this coloring matter with those of cyanine , we have found that the rose-red coloring matter is the same as the blue , or at least results from a modification of the same independent principle .
It appears in the rose-red modification , when the juice of the plant , with which it exists in contact , possesses an acid reaction .
We have always observed this acid reaction in the juices of plants with red or rose-red coloration , while the blue juices of plants have always exhibited an alkaline reaction .
We have exposed most of the rose-red or <unk> flowers which are cultivated in the Paris Museum to the influence of alkalies , and have seen that they first become blue and then green by their action .
It is often perceived that certain rose-red flowers , as those of the _ <unk> _ , and in particular those of the _ <unk> <unk> _ , <unk> by <unk> a blue and then a green coloration , which change , as we have found , depends on the decomposition of an organic nitrogenous substance , which is found very frequently in the petals .
This body <unk> as it <unk> ammonia , which communicates to the flowers the blue or green color .
By action of weak acids , the petals can be restored to their rose-red color .
The alteration of color of certain rose-red flowers can also be observed when the petals are very rapidly dried , for example , in _ <unk> _ , by which it cannot be easily assumed that a nitrogenous body has <unk> decomposition to the evolution of ammonia .
But , before all things , it must be mentioned that in this case the modification of color passes into violet , and never <unk> at green ; and , further , that it is always <unk> with the evolution of carbonic acid , which we have detected by a direct experiment .
<unk> which were before rose-red , and have become violet by slight drying , evolve carbonic acid , and on that account it may be assumed that the rose-red color is produced in the petals by this carbonic acid , and that by its expulsion the petals assume the blue color , by which the flowers with neutral juices are <unk> .
We believe that we are able to speak with certainty that flowers with a rose-red , violet , or blue color , owe their coloration to one and the same substance , but which is modified in various ways by the influence of the juices of plants .
<unk> flowers also contain cyanine reddened by an acid , but in such cases this substance is mixed with a yellow coloring matter which we will now describe .
_ Yellow Coloring Matter . _ --The simplest experiments show that no analogy exists between the substance which colors flowers yellow and that of which we have already spoken .
The agents which generate so easily with cyanine , the rose-red , violet , or green coloration , cannot in any case impart these colors to the yellow substance obtained from flowers .
By the examination of the various <unk> flowers , we have <unk> that they owe their coloration to two substances , which differ from one another in their properties , and appear not to be derived from the same independent principle .
One is completely insoluble in water , which we have termed xanthine , a name which <unk> has given to a yellow matter from <unk> .
As this name has not been accepted in science , we have employed it to denote one of the coloring matters of yellow flowers .
The other substance is very soluble in water , and is by us termed xantheine .
_ Xanthine , or the Yellow Coloring Matter insoluble in water . _ --We have prepared this coloring matter from many yellow flowers , but chiefly from _ <unk> <unk> _ .
To obtain it we treat the flowers with boiling absolute alcohol , which dissolves the coloring matter in the heat , and by cooling almost completely allows it again to precipitate .
The yellow deposit which is obtained in this way , is not pure xanthine , as it contains a rather considerable quantity of oil .
To separate this oil we have recourse to a moderate saponification ; thus , we heat the yellow precipitate with a small quantity of alkali to <unk> the fatty body mixed with the xanthine , which even contains the xanthine dissolved .
As the coloring matter is soluble in the soap solution , we do not treat the mass with water , but decompose it with an acid which <unk> the xanthine and the fatty acids resulting from the saponification .
This precipitate we treat with cold alcohol , which leaves behind the fatty acids , and dissolves the xanthine .
This substance is a fine yellow color , insoluble in water , but soluble in alcohol and ether , which are thereby colored <unk> yellow .
It appears to be uncrystallizable , and possesses the general properties of resins .

The solution is evaporated to dryness , and the residue treated with water , whereby the fat and resin are separated .
The water is again evaporated to dryness , and the residue treated with absolute alcohol .
The resulting solution diluted with water is mixed with neutral acetate of lead , which precipitates the coloring matters .

This improved process consists of two parts : <unk> , the application of <unk> steam to heat the fatty matters under treatment , by which means the requisite heat for melting these substances is obtained , and at the same time the atmosphere is thereby excluded ; the heated steam so applied in its passage off , carries with it the offensive smells given off by the fatty matters , and being made to <unk> a pipe or passage up or along which <unk> chlorine is allowed to flow , a complete <unk> of the offensive products is thereby effected .

For this purpose , Mr. Wilson takes at the <unk> , say , of a ton of yellow bees &apos; -wax , and melts and boils it up with free steam for about half an hour .
It is then allowed to stand a short time , and is then decanted into another vessel provided with a <unk> to emit free steam ; about 20 lbs .
of chlorate of potash is added , and the steam turned on ; 80 lbs .
of sulphuric acid , diluted with a like weight of water , is then gradually added .
The matters are allowed to stand for a short time , and are then decanted into another vessel , and again boiled up with free steam , and treated with a like quantity of diluted sulphuric acid .
The bees &apos; -wax is then decanted into a receiver , and is ready for use .
The bees &apos; -wax may , before undergoing these processes , be combined and boiled up with a hard fatty acid , and then treated as above described .

The removal of the duty from soap , and the consequent <unk> of this branch of industry from the tender <unk> of the Excise , has given a fresh <unk> to the manufacture of this important article of daily use , and enabled some processes to be practically carried out in England , which , previous to the removal of the duty , could not be adopted in this part of her <unk> &apos;s <unk> .
It will doubtless appear <unk> to those unacquainted with the circumstances , that owing to the mode of <unk> the duty by <unk> , and not by actual weight , the maker of a particular kind of soap was <unk> the <unk> of manufacturing in this country .
<unk> for him , the manufacture of soap being free from all Excise restrictions in Ireland , he was enabled to carry out his process in the <unk> kingdom , whence it was exported to England , and admitted here on <unk> of the <unk> &apos; duty , which was the same as the Excise duty on its manufacture here .
All this <unk> method of doing business is now done away with , and no <unk> now exists to <unk> the peace of the soap manufacturer .
Amongst various new processes lately introduced is that of Mr. <unk> <unk> , which is practically carried out in the following manner : -- <unk> <unk> lbs .

Mix these perfectly with the above-mentioned stearic or margaric acids , and <unk> alkali ; then add a strong solution of caustic potash or soda , until a perfect saponification is produced .
The dose of caustic alkali will much depend upon the purity of the stearine or margarine employed .
The separation is now effected by using common salt , or sulphate of soda , &amp; c . , as is known and practised by soap manufacturers .
If the soap intended to be produced is to be colorless , no resin must be employed , and a larger dose of liquor ammoniÃ¦ and caustic alkali must be used , according to the dryness of the stearine matters to be <unk> upon .
* * * * * A SIMPLE AND <unk> METHOD TO <unk> THE <unk> <unk> OF SOAP .
BY DR. <unk> <unk> .
In consequence of the <unk> process by which the fatty acids are determined in one portion of the soap , and the alkali by the <unk> of another , I consider the following method is not <unk> of publication , because it appears to afford quicker and more correct results by reason of the greater simplicity of the manipulation .
It is available principally for soda soaps , which are the most common ; but it may be also employed with corresponding <unk> for soaps which have other bases .
A piece of soap weighing two or three grammes is dissolved in a <unk> beaker glass of about 160 cubic centimetres <unk> with 80 to 100 cubic centimetres of water , by heat , in a water-bath , and then three or four times the quantity of diluted sulphuric acid or as much as is necessary to decompose the soap , added from a <unk> .
When , after repeated agitation , the fatty acids have separated in a transparent clear stratum from the <unk> solution , it is allowed to cool , and then the contents of the beaker glass are placed in a moistened filter , which has been previously dried at 212 Â° Fahr .
and weighed .
The contents of the filter are washed until their acid reaction disappears .
In the <unk> the beaker glass is placed in a <unk> , so that , it being already dry , may support the washed and partly dry filter , which is laid on the mouth of the glass as if it were in the funnel .
The fatty acids soon pass through the paper , and for the most part flow ultimately to the bottom of the beaker glass ; the increase of weight of which , after cooling , and the subtraction of the weight of the filter , gives the quantity of fatty acids present in the soap .
A second drying and weighing is not necessary , if on the cold sides of the interior of the glass no damp is to be observed , which is occasioned by a trace of water still present .
If the quantity of oxide of iron added to marble the soap is considerable , it may be easily found by <unk> the filter and <unk> the weight of the residue .
The fluid runs from the fatty acids on the filter , which , with the <unk> , has been preserved in a sufficiently large beaker glass , is colored with tincture of litmus , and decomposed with a test alkaline solution until the blue color appears .
The difference of the quantity of alkali required to <unk> the sulphuric acid , and the quantity of sulphuric acid used in the first instance , allows a calculation to be made as to the quantity of effective alkali in the soap , for example : -- <unk> grms .

A determination of the alkali as a sulphate <unk> in another portion of soap <unk> per cent .
of soda , because the sulphate of soda and chloride of sodium present in the soap gave up their alkali .
The alkaline fluid applied by me was a <unk> solution of lime , which can be naturally <unk> by a solution of soda , and must be if the chloride of sodium and sulphate of soda mixed with the soap shall be determined in the following way : -- The fluid again exactly neutralized with alkali is evaporated to dryness , and the residue gently heated to <unk> .
As in the above manipulation , the fluid was not heated to the boiling point , the original chloride of sodium and sulphate of soda are contained in the weighed residue , besides the soda of the soap and that which has been added with the sulphuric acid , forming sulphate of soda .
A second exposure to a red heat with sulphuric acid <unk> the whole residue into sulphate of soda , and from the increase of weight , by a comparison of the equivalents of <unk> and <unk> , <unk> _ { 3 } the quantity of the former may be decided .
According to the equivalents which <unk> <unk> in <unk> , the increase of weight to the chloride of sodium is as 1 : <unk> .
The original sulphate of soda must be , lastly , found by the subtraction of the same salt formed plus the calculated chloride of sodium from the first heated residue .
In practice , it is seldom necessary to proceed with the determination of the chloride of sodium and sulphate of soda , except with stirred and cocoa-nut oil soaps ; certainly less of the truth is seen if , after the above determination of the fatty acids and the effective alkali , the <unk> per centage of water is introduced in the calculation , than if the water is reckoned , which is never completely evolved from soap , even technically prepared at <unk> Â° Fahr . , and another determination made of the fatty acids or alkali _ en <unk> _ the fatty acids , or even the alkaline contents .
The method here given <unk> of the usual imperfections , that the fatty acids as well as the <unk> soap are equally estimated , and the mixed hydrate or carbonate of the alkali as well as the combined alkali .
The presence of the carbonate can be easily recognized by the <unk> of the soap solution , upon the addition of the sulphuric acid .
These imperfections , however , are of little importance .
It must be granted that the <unk> correct determination of the constitution of soap must be always yielded up to those who are technically <unk> with this department of chemistry , the estimation of free alkali and unchanged fat excluded in , at least , by certain ages of the soap .
Further , a considerable excess of one or another ingredient soon <unk> itself by a corresponding <unk> in the soap of the characteristic properties of a good product , and a small excess can be <unk> sufficiently exact from the proportion of the alkali , which , <unk> soda present , should not amount to more than <unk> per cent .

BY DR. <unk> <unk> .
The fats which exist in nature can be divided into the general and the special ; the former exist in almost all plants and parts of plants ; the latter includes only some vegetable substances , as _ <unk> _ , _ <unk> _ , and _ palmatine _ .
The consistence of fats of the general kind depend upon the proportions of margarine , stearine , and oleine contained in them .
The former <unk> in the solid fats ( butter , lard , and tallow ) ; and the latter in the fluid ones or oils .
According as an oil contains oleic acid or <unk> acid , it is termed a fatty or drying oil .
To the class of fatty oils <unk> olive , almond , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> oils , &amp; c . ; to that of drying oils , linseed , nut , <unk> , poppy , <unk> , oils , &amp; c . ; which are used for varnishes .
In the vegetable kingdom the fats are chiefly in the seeds and in their <unk> , seldom in the <unk> ( poppy ) , and in the fleshy substance <unk> the seed ( olive ) .
The fat in the seed is mostly enclosed in cells with a proteine compound .
In the animal kingdom certain parts of the body are quite filled with <unk> , particularly under the skin ( _ <unk> <unk> _ ) , in the <unk> of the <unk> , in the so-called _ <unk> _ , in the <unk> and the tubulated <unk> of the <unk> .
Fat is also enclosed in cells ( fatty <unk> ) in milk .
It is established , without a doubt , that a greater portion of the fat which exists in the animal kingdom <unk> from the vegetable kingdom , for it is introduced into the body <unk> with the proteine compounds of that kingdom .
A portion of the fat as well as wax is formed in the animal <unk> , as shown by a number of observations , and in most cases it is <unk> that the <unk> <unk> , as starch , serve for the formation of fat by a process of <unk> ; nevertheless , the formation of fat in the animal body appears only to take place when the substances containing starch enter the body <unk> with fat .
If the fat existing in the animal body is contained in <unk> tissue , its separation may be simply effected by placing the <unk> tissue in hot water .
The cells burst and the fat <unk> itself on the surface of the water .
If vegetable substances contain fat in large quantity , as , for example , seeds , it may be obtained by expression .
The dried seeds are bruised and expressed between either cold or hot metallic <unk> .
<unk> are laid in <unk> before expression ; when they <unk> to ferment , they can be completely expressed .
If animal and vegetable substances contain only a little fat , it must be extracted by ether .
In the pure condition the fats are mostly <unk> and <unk> ; when they possess an odor , it arises mostly from the presence of small quantities of volatile fatty acids , as butyric acid , <unk> acid , &amp; c . ; which becomes free through the decomposition of their oxide of glycyl combinations .
This ensues by the presence of water and air through a kind of fermentation , and as it appears , by the presence of a nitrogenous substance .
The fats are insoluble in water , and , with the exception of castor oil , are taken up by cold alcohol in very small quantities , however , more in proportion as they contain oleine .
In boiling alcohol they are dissolved , but are , for the most part , again separated on cooling , particularly those rich in stearine .
All fats are taken up by ether but those containing stearine in the <unk> quantity .
Their specific <unk> <unk> between <unk> and <unk> .
When heated , fats assume a dark color , and boil between <unk> Â° and <unk> Â° Fahr . , but the boiling-point <unk> rises , while an <unk> decomposition <unk> .
From oxide of glycyl ensues <unk> ; oleic acid affords a fatty acid , and among the decomposition products of fats containing stearine and margarine are found pure margaric acid , and , at the same time , some <unk> are formed .
When exposed quickly to a high temperature , fats are completely decomposed .
( Oil gas . )
In closed vessels the pure fats undergo no change , but , placed in thin layers in the air , the fats containing oleine and <unk> rapidly absorb oxygen under the strong evolution of heat , which will <unk> porous bodies , as cotton wool .
The purer the fats are the more quickly their oxidation results .
When the fats contain <unk> materials , these latter can be destroyed with a little oxide of lead and water .
( Preparation for the application of varnishes . )
The action of nitric acid , nitrous acid , chlorine , sulphuric acid , &amp; c . , on fats is the same as that of these bodies on the fatty acids .
The fatty oils dissolve sulphur in the heat which is again partly precipitated on cooling .
When sulphur is heated with fatty oils , namely , with linseed oil , it dissolves by degrees , and a thick dark mass is formed , the so-called balsam of sulphur .
By <unk> the heat , a <unk> reaction ensues under the evolution of sulphuretted hydrogen , and , at the same time , an oil resembling oil of <unk> volatilizes .
This oil begins to boil at 160 Â° Fahr . , but its boiling-point rises <unk> .
* * * * * PERFUMES <unk> <unk> OF <unk> .
An interesting paper on this subject has been published by Dr. Macculloch .
We presume our readers are aware that <unk> is occasioned by the growth of minute <unk> .
<unk> , paste , leather , and seeds , are the substances that most frequently <unk> from it .
The effect of cloves in preserving ink is well known ; any of the essential oils answer equally well .
<unk> may be kept free from mould by the same substances .
Thus <unk> leather , which is perfumed with the tar of birch , never becomes <unk> ; indeed it prevents it from <unk> in other bodies .
A few drops of any essential oil are sufficient also to keep books entirely free from it .
For <unk> , oil of turpentine is recommended .
<unk> , in general , employ alum for preserving their paste ; but mould frequently forms on it .
<unk> &apos; resin is sometimes also used for the same purpose ; but it is less <unk> than oil of turpentine .
The best <unk> , however , are the essential oils , even in small quantity , as those of peppermint , anise , or cassia , by which paste may be kept almost any length of time ; indeed , it has , in this way , been preserved for years .
The paste recommended by Dr. Macculloch is made in the usual way , with flour , some brown sugar , and a little <unk> sublimate ; the sugar keeping it <unk> when dry , and the sublimate preventing it from <unk> , and from being attacked by <unk> .
After it is made , a few drops of any of the essential oils are added .
<unk> made in this way dries when exposed to the air , and may be used merely by <unk> it .
If required to be kept always ready for use , it ought to be put into covered pots .
<unk> may also be preserved by the essential oils ; and this is of great consequence , when they are to be sent to a <unk> .
Of course moisture must be excluded as much as possible , as the oils or ottos prevent only the bad effects of mould .

This organic compound was first discovered by Scheele , as one of the distillation products of the <unk> obtained from the fermentation of potatoes .
It has been <unk> examined by <unk> , <unk> , Cahours , and others .
It is generally now termed the hydrate of the oxide of amyl , from amyl being supposed to be its base or radical , as <unk> is regarded to be the radical of another series of compounds .
It passes over towards the <unk> of the distillation process in a white <unk> fluid , which consists of a watery and alcoholic solution of the fusel oil .
The crude oil , consisting of about one-half of its weight of alcohol and water , may be purified , being shaken with water and redistilled , with the previous addition of chloride of calcium .
When the temperature of the contents of retort reaches 296 Â° Fahr . , pure fusel oil distils over .
Fusel oil is a colorless oily fluid , which possesses at first not an <unk> odor , but at last is very disgusting , producing <unk> at the <unk> and <unk> cough .
It has a <unk> hot taste , and <unk> with a white blue flame .
It boils at 296 Â° Fahr . , and at temperature of <unk> Â° Fahr .
it becomes solid , and forms crystals .
Its specific gravity at <unk> Â° Fahr .
is <unk> , and its formula C _ { 10 } H _ { 12 } O _ { 2 } .
On paper it produces a greasy stain , which disappears by heat , and when exposed to the action of the air it acquires an acid reaction .
Fusel oil is slightly soluble in water , to which it imparts its odor ; and soluble in all proportions in alcohol , ether , volatile and fixed oils , and acetic acid .
It dissolves <unk> , sulphur , and <unk> without any <unk> change , and also mixes with caustic soda and potash .
It rapidly absorbs hydrochloric acid , with the <unk> of heat .
When mixed with concentrated sulphuric acid , the mixture becomes of a <unk> color , and <unk> of amyloxide is formed .
<unk> acid and chlorine decompose it .
By its distillation with <unk> <unk> acid , a fluid , oily combination of hydrogen and carbon results .
By oxidation with bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid , fusel oil yields valerianic acid , which is used in medicine , and apple-oil , employed as a flavoring ingredient in confectionery .
* * * * * ESSENCE OF <unk> .
BY W. BASTICK .
The above essence is , as already known , butyric ether more or less diluted with alcohol ; to obtain which pure , on the large scale and <unk> , the following process is recommended : -- Dissolve 6 lbs .
of sugar and half an ounce of tartaric acid , in 26 lbs .
of boiling water .
Let the solution stand for several days ; then add 8 ounces of <unk> cheese broken up with 3 lbs .
of skimmed and curdled sour milk and 3 lbs .
of levigated chalk .
The mixture should be kept and stirred daily in a warm place , at the temperature of about <unk> Â° Fahr . , as long as gas is evolved , which is generally the case for five or six weeks .
The liquid thus obtained , is mixed with an equal volume of cold water , and 8 lbs .
of crystallized carbonate of soda , previously dissolved in water , added .
It is then filtered from the precipitated carbonate of lime ; the filtrate is to be evaporated down to 10 lbs . , when <unk> / 2 lbs .
of sulphuric acid , previously diluted with an equal weight of water , are to be carefully added .
The butyric acid , which separates on the surface of the liquid as a <unk> oil , is to be removed , and the rest of the liquid distilled ; the distillate is now neutralized with carbonate of soda , and the butyric acid separated as before , with sulphuric acid .
The whole of the crude acid is to be rectified with the addition of an ounce of sulphuric acid to every pound .
The distillate is then saturated with fused chloride of calcium , and redistilled .
The product will be about 28 ounces of pure butyric acid .
To prepare the butyric acid or essence of pine-apple , from this acid proceed as follows : <unk> , by weight , three parts of butyric acid with six parts of alcohol , and two parts of sulphuric acid in a retort , and <unk> the whole , with a sufficient heat , to a gentle distillation , until the fluid which passes over ceases to emit a fruity odor .
By treating the distillate with chloride of calcium , and by its <unk> , the pure ether may be obtained .
The boiling-point of butyric ether is <unk> Â° Fahr .
Its specific gravity , <unk> , and its formula , C _ { 12 } H _ { 12 } O _ { 4 } , or C _ { 4 } H _ { 5 } O + C _ { 8 } H _ { 7 } O _ { 3 } .
Bensch &apos;s process , above described , for the production of butyric acid , affords a remarkable <unk> of the extraordinary transformations that organic bodies undergo in contact with ferment , or by catalytic action .
When <unk> sugar is treated with tartaric acid , especially under the influence of heat , it is converted into grape sugar .
This grape sugar , in the presence of decomposing nitrogenous substances , such as cheese , is <unk> in the first instance into <unk> acid , which combines with the lime of the chalk .
The acid of the <unk> of lime , thus produced , is by the further influence of the ferment changed into butyric acid .
Hence , butyrate of lime is the final result of the catalytic action in the process we have here recommended .
* * * * * PREPARATION OF <unk> <unk> OF <unk> ( ESSENCE OF <unk> . )
BY DR. R. WAGNER .
It has been believed , until the most recent period , that the peel of quinces contains <unk> of ethyl-oxide .
<unk> researches , however , have led to the supposition that the odorous principle of quinces is derived from the ether of pelargonic acid .
In my last research on the action of nitric acid on oil of rue , I found that besides the fatty acids , which <unk> had already discovered , pelargonic acid is formed .
This process may be advantageously employed for the preparation of crude <unk> of ethyl-oxide , which , on account of its <unk> agreeable odor , may be applied as a fruit essence equally with those prepared by <unk> , <unk> , and Fehling .
For the preparation of the liquid , which can be named the essence of quince , oil of rue is treated with double its quantity of very diluted nitric acid , and the mixture heated until it begins to boil .
After some time two layers are to be observed in the liquid : the upper one is brownish , and the lower one consists of the products of the oxidation of oil of rue and the excess of nitric acid .
The lower layer is freed from the greater part of its nitric acid by evaporation in a chloride of zinc bath .
The white flocks frequently found in the acid liquid , which are probably fatty acids , are separated by filtration .
The filtrate is mixed with spirit , and long digested in a gentle heat , by which a fluid is formed , which has the agreeable odor of quince in the highest degree , and may be purified by distillation .

_ <unk> Oil _ is a solution of one part of butyric ether , in eight or ten parts of alcohol .
For the preparation of this ether , pure butyric acid must be first obtained by the fermentation of sugar , according to the method of Bensch .
One pound of this acid is dissolved in one pound of strong alcohol , and mixed with from a quarter to half an ounce of sulphuric acid ; the mixture is heated for some minutes , whereby the butyric ether separates as a light stratum .
The whole is mixed with half its volume of water , and the upper stratum then removed ; the <unk> fluid is distilled , by which more butyric ether is obtained .
The distillate and the removed oily liquid are shaken with a little water , the <unk> portion of the liquid removed , which at last , by being shaken with water and a little soda , is freed from adhering acid .
For the preparation of the essence of pine-apple , one pound of this ether is dissolved in 8 or 10 pounds of alcohol .
20 or 25 drops of this solution is sufficient to give to one pound of sugar a strong taste of pine-apple , if a little citric or tartaric acid has been added .
_ <unk> . _ <unk> is an alcoholic solution of acetate of amyloxide , and acetate of ethyloxide .
For its preparation , one pound of <unk> acetic acid is added to an equal weight of fusel-oil ( which has been prepared by being washed with soda and water , and then distilled at a temperature between 254 Â° and <unk> Â° Fahr .
) , and mixed with half a pound of sulphuric acid .
The mixture is digested for some hours at a temperature of 254 Â° , by which means acetate of amyloxide separates , particularly on the addition of some water .
The crude acetate of amyloxide obtained by separation , and by the distillation of the liquid to which the water has been added , is finally purified by being washed with soda and water .
<unk> parts of acetate of amyloxide are dissolved with half a part of acetic ether in 100 or <unk> parts of alcohol ; this is the essence of pear , which , when employed to flavor sugar or syrup , to which a little citric or tartaric acid has been added , affords the flavor of bergamot <unk> , and a fruity , refreshing taste .
_ <unk> _ is an alcoholic solution of valerianate of amyloxide .
It is obtained impure , as a by product , when for the preparation of valerianic acid , fusel-oil is distilled with bichromate of potash and sulphuric acid .
It is better prepared in the following manner : --For the preparation of valerianic acid , 1 part of fusel-oil is mixed gradually with 3 parts of sulphuric acid , and 2 parts of water added .
A solution of 2-1 / 4 parts of bichromate of potash , with 4-1 / 2 parts of water , is heated in a tubulated retort , and into this fluid the former mixture is gradually poured , so that the <unk> is not too rapid .
The distillate is saturated with carbonate of soda , and warmed , when a solution of 3 parts of crystallized carbonate of soda , 2 parts of strong sulphuric acid , diluted with an equal quantity of water , are added .
The valerianic acid separates as an oily stratum .
One part , by weight , of pure fusel-oil is carefully mixed with an equal weight of sulphuric acid .
The cold solution is added to 1-1 / 4 parts of the above valerianic acid ; the mixture is warmed for some minutes ( not too long or too much ) in a water-bath , and then mixed with a little water , by which means the impure valerianate of amyloxide separates , which is washed with water and carbonate of soda .
For use as an essence of apples , one part of this valerianate of amyloxide is dissolved in 6 or 8 parts of alcohol .

The chemical <unk> of this oil is one of great importance and interest , <unk> , as it does , one of the <unk> where the <unk> of modern chemistry has succeeded in producing artificially a complex organic body , previously only known as the result of vital force .
This volatile oil is obtained from the winter-green , an American shrub of the <unk> family , by distillation .
When this plant is distilled , at first an oil passes over which consists of C _ { 10 } H _ { 8 } , but when the temperature reaches <unk> Â° Fahr . , a pure oil distils into the receiver .
<unk> the essential oil of this plant , like many others , consists of two <unk> a hydro-carbon , and the other an <unk> compound ; this latter is the chief <unk> of the oil , and that which is of so much chemical interest , from the fact that it has been artificially prepared .
It is termed , when thus prepared , the spiroylate of the oxide of methyl , and is obtained when two parts of wood spirit , one and a half parts of spiroylic acid , and one part of sulphuric acid are distilled together .
It is a colorless liquid , of an agreeable aromatic odor and taste ; it dissolves slightly in water , but in all proportions in ether and alcohol ; it boils between <unk> Â° and <unk> Â° Fahr . , and has a specific gravity of <unk> .
This compound <unk> carbonic acid from its combinations , and forms a series of salts , which contain one atom of base and one atom of spiroylate of the oxide of methyl .
It <unk> therefore as a <unk> acid .
Its formula is C _ { 14 } H _ { 5 } O _ { 5 } + C _ { 2 } H _ { 3 } <unk>
The spiroylic acid may be separated from the natural oil by treating it with a concentrated solution of caustic potash at a temperature of <unk> Â° Fahr . , when wood spirit is formed and <unk> , and the solution contains the spiroylate of potash , from which , when decomposed with sulphuric acid , the spiroylic acid separates and <unk> in the fluid .
<unk> acid is also formed by the oxidation of <unk> acid , and when <unk> , salicin , <unk> , or indigo , is heated with caustic potash .

Cahours &apos; excellent researches concerning the essential oil of _ Gaultheria <unk> _ ( a North American plant of the natural order of the <unk> of <unk> ) , which <unk> of so many applications in perfumery , &#91; I &#93; have opened a new field in this branch of industry .
The introduction of this oil among compound ethers must necessarily direct the attention of perfumers &#91; J &#93; towards this important branch of compounds , the number of which is daily increasing by the <unk> of those who apply themselves to organic chemistry .
The striking similarity of the smell of these ethers to that of fruit had not escaped the observation of chemistry ; however , it was reserved to practical men to discover by which <unk> and combinations it might be possible to <unk> the scent of peculiar fruits to such a nicety , that makes it probable that the scent of the fruit is owing to a natural combination identical to that produced by art ; so much so , as to <unk> the chemist to produce from fruits the said combinations , provided he could have at his <unk> a sufficient quantity to operate upon .
The manufacture of artificial aromatic oils for the purpose of perfumery &#91; K &#93; is , of course , a recent branch of industry ; nevertheless , it has already fallen into the hands of several distillers , who produce sufficient quantity to supply the trade ; a fact , which has not escaped the observation of the <unk> at the London Exhibition .
In <unk> the <unk> of English and French perfumers at the Crystal Palace , we found a great variety of these chemical perfumes , the applications of which were at the same time practically <unk> by confectionery flavored by them .
However , as most of the samples of the oils sent to the Exhibition were but small , I was prevented , in many cases , from making an accurate analysis of them .
The largest samples were those of a compound labelled &quot; pear-oil , &quot; which , by analysis , I discovered to be an alcoholic solution of pure acetate of amyloxide .
<unk> having sufficient quantity to <unk> it for combustion , I dissolved it with potash , by which free fusel-oil was separated , and determined the acetic acid in the form of a silver salt .
<unk> gram .
of silver salt = <unk> gram .
of silver .
The per centage of silver in acetate of silver is , according to Theory , <unk> Experiment , <unk> The acetate of amyloxide , which , according to the usual way of preparing it , <unk> one part sulphuric acid , one part fusel-oil , and two parts of acetate of potash , had a striking smell of fruit , but it acquired the pleasant flavor of the jargonelle pear only after having been diluted with six times its volume of spirit of wine .
Upon further inquiry I <unk> that considerable quantities of this oil are manufactured by some distillers , <unk> fifteen to twenty pounds <unk> , <unk> sold to confectioners , who employ it chiefly in flavoring <unk> , which are nothing else but <unk> , flavored with this oil .
I found , besides the pear-oil , also an _ apple-oil _ , which , according to my analysis , is nothing but valerianate of amyloxide .
Every one must <unk> the <unk> smell of <unk> apples which fills the laboratory whilst making valerianic acid .
By <unk> upon this raw distillate produced with diluted potash , valerianic acid is removed , and an ether remains behind , which , diluted in five or six times its volume of spirits of wine , is possessed of the most pleasant flavor of apples .
The essential oil &#91; L &#93; most abundant in the Exhibition was the pine-apple oil , which , as you well know , is nothing else but the butyrate of ethyloxide .
Even in this combination , like in the former , the pleasant flavor or scent is only attained by diluting the ether with alcohol .
The butyric ether which is employed in Germany to flavor bad rum , is employed in England to flavor an <unk> drink called pine-apple <unk> .
For this purpose they generally do not employ pure butyric acid , but a product obtained by saponification of butter , and subsequent distillation of the soap with concentrated sulphuric acid and alcohol ; which product contains , besides the butyric ether , other ethers , but nevertheless can be used for flavoring spirits .
The sample I <unk> was purer , and appeared to have been made with pure butyric ether .
<unk> with potash and changed into silver salt , it gave <unk> gram .
of silver salt = <unk> gram .
of silver .
The per centage of silver in the butyrate of silver is according to Theory , <unk> Experiment , <unk> Both English and French exhibitors have also sent samples of <unk> and grape-oil , which are employed to flavor the common sorts of brandy .
As these samples were very small , I was prevented from making an accurate analysis .
However , I am certain that the grape-oil is a combination of amyl , diluted with much alcohol ; since , when <unk> upon with concentrated sulphuric acid , and the oil freed from alcohol by washing it with water , it gave <unk> acid , which was <unk> by the analysis of the salt of barytes .

of <unk> of barytes gave <unk> gram .
of sulphate of barytes .
This <unk> to <unk> per cent .
of sulphate of barytes .
<unk> of barytes , crystallized with two equivalents of water , contains , according to the analysis of Cahours and <unk> , <unk> per cent .
of sulphate of barytes .
It is curious to find here a body , which , on account of its <unk> smell , is removed with great care from spirituous <unk> , to be applied under a different form for the purpose of imparting to them a pleasant flavor .
I must needs here also mention the artificial oil of bitter almonds .
When <unk> , in the year <unk> , discovered the nitrobenzol , he would not have <unk> that this product would be manufactured for the purpose of perfumery , and , after twenty years , appear in fine labelled samples at the London Exhibition .
It is true that , even at the time of the discovery of nitrobenzol , he <unk> out the striking similarity of its smell to that of the oil of bitter almonds .
However , at that time , the only known sources for obtaining this body were the compressed <unk> and the distillation of benzoic acid , consequently the <unk> of its price <unk> any idea of employing benzol as a substitute for oil of bitter almonds .
However , in the year <unk> , I succeeded by means of the <unk> in ascertaining the <unk> of benzol in common coal-tar oil ; and , in the year <unk> , <unk>
Mansfield proved , by careful experiments , that benzol can be <unk> without difficulty in great quantity from coal-tar oil .
In his <unk> , which contains many interesting details about the practical use of benzol , he speaks likewise of the possibility of soon obtaining the sweet-scented nitrobenzol in great quantity .
The Exhibition has proved that his observation has not been left unnoticed by the perfumers .
Among French <unk> we have found , under the name of artificial oil of bitter almonds , and under the still more poetical name of &quot; essence de <unk> , &quot; several samples of essential oils , which are no more nor less than nitrobenzol .
I was not able to obtain accurate details about the extent of this branch of manufacture , which seems to be of some importance .
In London , this article is manufactured with success .
The apparatus employed is that of Mansfield , which is very simple .
It consists of a large glass worm , the upper extremity of which divides in two branches or tubes , which are provided with funnels .
<unk> one of these funnels passes a stream of concentrated nitric acid ; the other is <unk> as a receiver of benzol , which , for this purpose , requires not to be quite pure ; at the <unk> from where the two tubes branch out , the two bodies meet together , and instantly the chemical combination takes place , which cools sufficiently by passing through the glass worm .
The product is afterwards washed with water , and some diluted solution of carbonate of soda ; it is then ready for use .
Notwithstanding the great physical similarity between nitrobenzol and oil of bitter almonds , there is yet a slight _ difference in smell which can be detected by an <unk> nose _ .
&#91; M &#93; However , nitrobenzol is very useful in scenting soap , and might be employed with great advantage by confectioners and cooks , particularly on account of its <unk> , being entirely free from prussic acid .
There were , besides the above , several other artificial oils ; they all , however , were more or less <unk> , and in so small quantities , that it was impossible to ascertain their exact nature , and it was <unk> whether they had the same origin as the former .
The application of organic chemistry to perfumery is quite new ; it is probable that the study of all the ethers or ethereal combinations already known , and of those which the <unk> of the chemist is daily <unk> , will <unk> the <unk> of their practical applications .
The <unk> lately discovered by <unk> are remarkable for their aromatic smells ( the acetate of <unk> is possessed of the most intense and pleasant smell ) , and they <unk> a large <unk> to the manufacturers of <unk> _ <unk> der Chemie . _ * * * * * <unk> FROM THE &quot; <unk> OF THE <unk> OF <unk> .
&quot; &#91; N &#93; CHEMISTRY AND PERFUMERY .
SIR , When such periodicals as &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; and the &quot; <unk> <unk> &quot; contain scientific matters , treated in a manner to <unk> science , all real lovers of <unk> must feel <unk> ; a little fiction , a little metaphor , is expected , and is accepted with the good <unk> with which it is given , in such popular <unk> ; but when the &quot; Journal of the Society of Arts &quot; <unk> <unk> from such sources , without <unk> or <unk> their <unk> , it conveys to its readers a tissue of fiction rather too <unk> to bear a <unk> analysis .
&#91; O &#93; In the article on Chemistry and Perfumery , in No .
47 , you quote that &quot; some of the most delicate perfumes are now made by chemical <unk> , and not , as of old , by distilling them from flowers . &quot;
Now , sir , this statement conveys to the public a very erroneous idea ; because the substances afterwards spoken of are named essences of fruit , and not essences of flowers , and the essences of fruits named in your article never are , and never can be , used in perfumery .
This assertion is based on practical experience .
The artificial essences of fruits are ethers : when poured upon a handkerchief , and held up to the nose , they act , as is well known , like <unk> .
<unk> a perfumer sell a bottle of such a preparation to an &quot; unprotected <unk> ? &quot;
Again , you quote that &quot; the <unk> of <unk> are the main source to which the manufacturer applies for the production of his most delicate and admired perfumes . &quot;
<unk> of <unk> !
must I refute this by calling your attention to the fact that in the south of France more than 80,000 persons are employed , directly and indirectly , in the cultivation of flowers , and in the extraction of their odors for the use of perfumers ?
that Italy cultivates flowers for the same purpose to an extent employing land as extensive as the whole of some English counties ?
that <unk> of flower-farms exist in the Balkan , in Turkey , more extensive than the whole of <unk> ?
<unk> own flower-farms at Mitcham , in Surrey , need not be mentioned in comparison , although important .
These , sir , are the main sources of perfumes .
There are other sources at Thibet , Tonquin , and in the West Indies ; but enough has been said , I hope , to refute the <unk> story .
This story is founded on the fact that Benzoic acid _ can be _ obtained from the <unk> of <unk> , and that Benzoic acid has rather a pleasant odor .
Some of the largest wholesale perfumers use five or six pounds of gum benzoin per annum , but none use the benzoic acid .
The <unk> consume the most of this article when prepared for commercial purposes ; as also the fruit essences .
Those of your readers <unk> in what _ really is used _ in perfumery , are referred to the last six <unk> of the &quot; Annals of Pharmacy and <unk> Chemistry , &quot; article &quot; Perfumery . &quot;
Your obedient servant , SEPTIMUS PIESSE .
CHEMISTRY AND PERFUMERY .
&#91; P &#93; SIR , The discussion about chemistry and perfumery , in reality <unk> to this : Mr. Septimus Piesse <unk> the term &quot; perfumery &quot; to such things as Eau de Cologne , &amp; c . ; perfumed soaps , groceries , &amp; c . , he does not appear to class as &quot; perfumery . &quot;
Now the artificial scents are as yet chiefly used for the latter substances , which in common <unk> , and , I should say , in a perfumer &apos;s nomenclature also , would be included in perfumery .
The authority for <unk> &apos; urine being used for perfumery is to be found in a little French work called , I believe , &quot; La <unk> de l <unk> &quot; in which a full description is given of the collection of fresh urine and its application to this purpose .
I need scarcely say , that it is the benzoic acid of the urine which is the odoriferous principle .
Your obedient servant , A PERFUMER .
&#91; When benzoic acid is prepared by any of the wet processes , it is _ free from the fragrant volatile oil _ which <unk> it when prepared by sublimation from the resin , and to which oil the acid of commerce owes its peculiar odor .
This fact completely <unk> the above <unk> PIESSE . &#93;
CHEMISTRY AND PERFUMERY .
&#91; Q &#93; Sir , If the author of the Letter on Chemistry and Perfumery , published in No .
50 of your Journal , and intended as a <unk> to <unk> none was <unk> appeared in No .
49 , really be a perfumer , as his <unk> implies , he would know that I could not , though ever so inclined , &quot; confine the term perfumery &quot; to various odoriferous substances , and exclude scented soaps ; because he would be aware that one-third of the returns of every manufacturing perfumer is derived from perfumed soap .
I do however <unk> exclude from the term perfumery , &quot; groceries , &amp; c . , &quot; the _ et <unk> _ meaning , I presume , &quot; confectionery , &quot; because perfumery has to do with one of the senses , SMELLING , while groceries , &amp; c . , are <unk> by another , <unk> ; and had not our physical faculties clearly made the distinction , commerce and manufactures would have <unk> them : I therefore repeat , that the artificial essences of fruits are not used in perfumery , as stated in No .
47 , from the <unk> authorities .
If any man can <unk> this assertion , let him now do so , &quot; or <unk> after hold his peace , &quot; at least upon this subject .
The &quot; Journal of the Society of Arts &quot; is not a medium of mere <unk> .
If a statement be made in error , let truth correct it , which , if <unk> , it should be done , not under the veil of an anonymous <unk> , but with a name to support the assertion .
Science has to deal with <unk> facts and <unk> , to the <unk> alone belongs the anonymous <unk> .
I am , sir , <unk> <unk> , SEPTIMUS PIESSE .
<unk> <unk> Street , <unk> <unk> .
&#91; If the word _ flavor _ had been used by the various authors who have written upon this subject , in place of the word _ perfume _ , the <unk> of an erroneous idea would have been prevented : the word perfume , applied to pear-oil , pine-apple oil , &amp; c . , implies , and the general <unk> of the remarks of the writers <unk> the reader to <unk> , that these substances are used by perfumers , who not only do not , but cannot use them in their trade .
But for _ flavoring _ <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , &amp; c . , these ethers , or oils as the writers term them , are extensively used , and quite in accordance with <unk> of Hoffman , Playfair , Fehling , and Bastick .
However , the <unk> <unk> of modern chemistry have not lost anything by this <unk> of a trade <unk> PIESSE . &#93;
